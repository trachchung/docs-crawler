The desktop host for OpenHuman: Tauri v2 + WebView, IPC commands, window management, and bridging to the `openhuman-core` Rust sidecar (core JSON-RPC). It does **not** duplicate the full domain stack; that lives in the repo-root Rust crate (`openhuman_core`, `src/main.rs`).
## 
Responsibilities
  1. **Web UI**. Load the Vite build from `app/dist` (or dev server on port 1420).
  2. **IPC**. Expose a small, explicit set of Tauri commands (see ).
  3. **Core lifecycle**. Ensure the `openhuman-core` binary is running (child process and/or service) and proxy JSON-RPC via `core_rpc_relay`.
  4. **AI prompts on disk**. Resolve bundled `src/openhuman/agent/prompts` from resources / dev cwd for `ai_get_config` / `write_ai_config_file`.
  5. **Window + tray**. Desktop window behavior and system tray (see `lib.rs`).


## 
Building the sidecar
`app/package.json` `core:stage` runs `scripts/stage-core-sidecar.mjs`, which runs `cargo build --bin openhuman-core` at the repo root and copies the binary into `app/src-tauri/binaries/` for Tauri `externalBin`.
## 
Stuck process recovery
Normal app quit runs teardown from `RunEvent::ExitRequested`: child webviews are closed before CEF shutdown, the embedded core's cancellation token is triggered, and the final process sweep sends `SIGTERM` to direct children before escalating holdouts with `SIGKILL` after a short grace period. Sweep summaries are logged as `[app] sweep: term=N kill=M total=K`; any nonzero `kill` count is a warning and means a child ignored graceful shutdown.
On macOS, hard exits (Force Quit, `SIGKILL`, renderer crash) can skip normal teardown. The next launch runs startup recovery before CEF cache preflight: it lists OpenHuman processes whose executable path belongs to the launching `.app/Contents`, skips the current process, sends `SIGTERM`, waits briefly, then `SIGKILL`s stragglers that still match the same pid+command. Logs use the `[startup-recovery]` prefix.
Startup recovery skips when `OPENHUMAN_CORE_REUSE_EXISTING=1` is set (so manual CLI-core reuse still works) and when the CEF `SingletonLock` is held by a live process (so the normal second-instance path can fail without killing the already-running app). The Tauri command `process_diagnostics_list_owned` returns the currently owned process list; the macOS implementation is bundle-scoped, Linux/Windows currently return empty.
## 
Tauri shell architecture (`app/src-tauri/`)
### 
Overview
The `**app/src-tauri**`crate (Rust package`**OpenHuman**`, binary`**OpenHuman**`) is a**desktop-only** host. It embeds the React UI, registers plugins (deep link, opener, OS, notifications, autostart, updater), manages the main window and tray, and **relays JSON-RPC** to the separately built `**openhuman-core**`binary.
Non-desktop targets fail at compile time (`compile_error!` in `lib.rs`).
### 
Directory layout (actual)
Copy
```
app/src-tauri/src/
├── lib.rs                 # `run()`, tray/menu actions, plugins, `generate_handler!`, core startup
├── main.rs                # Binary entry
├── core_process.rs        # CoreProcessHandle, spawn/monitor openhuman sidecar
├── core_rpc.rs            # HTTP client to core JSON-RPC
├── commands/
│   ├── mod.rs             # Re-exports
│   ├── core_relay.rs      # `core_rpc_relay`, service-managed core bootstrap
│   ├── openhuman.rs       # Daemon host config, systemd-style service helpers
│   └── window.rs          # show/hide/minimize/close window
└── utils/
    ├── mod.rs
    └── dev_paths.rs       # Resolve bundled AI prompts paths
```

There is **no** `src-tauri/src/services/session_service.rs` in this tree; session semantics are handled in the web layer + backend + core as applicable.
### 
Data flow: UI → core
Copy
```
React (invoke)
    → core_rpc_relay { method, params, serviceManaged? }
        → core_rpc::call HTTP POST to OPENHUMAN_CORE_RPC_URL
            → openhuman binary (src/bin/openhuman.rs → core_server)
```

`CoreProcessHandle` in `core_process.rs` starts or waits for the sidecar; `commands/core_relay.rs` optionally ensures a **service-managed** core is running before relaying.
### 
Window and tray behavior
  * The shell creates a tray icon at startup and wires actions to open the main window or quit.
  * In daemon mode (`daemon` / `--daemon`), the main window is hidden on launch and can be reopened from tray actions.
  * On macOS `RunEvent::Reopen` also restores and focuses the main window.
  * Windows and Linux use the same tray actions (`Open OpenHuman`, `Quit`), with desktop-environment-specific tray rendering differences on some Linux setups.


### 
Bundled resources
`tauri.conf.json` bundles `**../../skills/skills**`and`**../../src/openhuman/agent/prompts**`so skills and prompt markdown ship with the app.
### 
Related
  * IPC surface: see the section below
  * HTTP bridge: see the section below
  * Rust domains (implementation): repo root `src/openhuman/`, `src/core_server/`


## 
Tauri IPC commands (`app/src-tauri`)
All commands are registered in `**app/src-tauri/src/lib.rs**`inside`tauri::generate_handler![...]` (desktop build). Names below are the **Rust** command names (camelCase in JS via serde where applicable).
### 
Demo / diagnostics
Command
Purpose
`greet`
Demo string (safe to remove in production)
### 
AI configuration (bundled prompts)
Command
Purpose
`ai_get_config`
Build `AIPreview` from resolved `SOUL.md` / `TOOLS.md` under bundled or dev `src/openhuman/agent/prompts`
`ai_refresh_config`
Same read path as `ai_get_config` (refresh hook)
`write_ai_config_file`
Write a single `.md` under repo `src/openhuman/agent/prompts` (dev / safe filename checks)
### 
Core JSON-RPC relay
Command
Purpose
`core_rpc_relay`
Body: `{ method, params?, serviceManaged? }` → forwards to local `**openhuman-core**`HTTP JSON-RPC (`core_rpc.rs`)
Use `**app/src/services/coreRpcClient.ts**`(`callCoreRpc`) from the frontend.
### 
Window management
From `**commands/window.rs**`(names may vary slightly; see`lib.rs`):
Command
Purpose
`show_window`
Show main window
`hide_window`
Hide main window
`toggle_window`
Toggle visibility
`is_window_visible`
Query visibility
`minimize_window`
Minimize
`maximize_window`
Maximize
`close_window`
Close
`set_window_title`
Set title string
### 
OpenHuman daemon / service helpers
From `**commands/openhuman.rs**`(see source for exact payloads):
Command
Purpose
`openhuman_get_daemon_host_config`
Read daemon host preferences (e.g. tray)
`openhuman_set_daemon_host_config`
Persist daemon host preferences
`openhuman_service_install`
Install background service (platform-specific)
`openhuman_service_start`
Start service
`openhuman_service_stop`
Stop service
`openhuman_service_status`
Query status
`openhuman_service_uninstall`
Uninstall service
### 
Screen share picker (CEF / macOS)
From `**screen_capture/mod.rs**`. Backs the in-page`getDisplayMedia` shim in `webview_accounts/runtime.js`. Session-gated: the shim must open a session with a live user gesture before enumeration / thumbnail captures succeed. See issue #713 (picker UX) + #812 (session gating).
Command
Purpose
`screen_share_begin_session`
Open a 30s session from an account webview, after a `navigator.userActivation.isActive` gesture. Returns `{ token, sources }`. Rate-limited to 10/minute per account.
`screen_share_thumbnail`
Capture a single source's thumbnail as base64 PNG. Requires a live token and an `id` that the session was issued for. macOS only; other platforms return an error.
`screen_share_finalize_session`
Close the session. Called by the shim on Share or Cancel; safe to call with an unknown/expired token (no-op).
### 
Removed / not present
The following **do not** exist in the current `generate_handler!` list: `exchange_token`, `get_auth_state`, `socket_connect`, `start_telegram_login`. Authentication and sockets are handled in the **React** app and **core** process, not via these IPC names.
### 
Example: core RPC
Copy
```
import { invoke } from "@tauri-apps/api/core";
const result = await invoke("core_rpc_relay", {
  request: {
    method: "your.rpc.method",
    params: { foo: "bar" },
    serviceManaged: false,
});
```

_See_` _app/src-tauri/src/lib.rs_`_for the authoritative list._
## 
Core bridge & helpers (`app/src-tauri`)
This document replaces the old “SessionService / SocketService” split. The Tauri crate **does not** embed a duplicate Socket.io server or Telegram client; instead it focuses on **process management** and **HTTP JSON-RPC** to the `**openhuman-core**`binary.
### 
`CoreProcessHandle` (`core_process.rs`)
  * Resolves the `**openhuman-core**`executable (staged under`binaries/` or `PATH` / dev layout).
  * Starts or attaches to the core process and exposes its RPC URL (`OPENHUMAN_CORE_RPC_URL`).
  * Used during app setup in `lib.rs` (`app.manage(core_handle)`).


### 
`core_rpc` (`core_rpc.rs`)
  * HTTP client for the core’s JSON-RPC surface (localhost).
  * Used by `**core_rpc_relay**`to forward`method` + `params` from the frontend.


### 
`commands/core_relay.rs`
  * `**core_rpc_relay**`. ensures the core is running (in-process handle or**service-managed** path), then calls `core_rpc`.
  * `**ensure_service_managed_core_running**`. bootstraps systemd/launchd-style service when RPC is down (platform-specific behavior inside core CLI).


### 
`commands/openhuman.rs`
  * Daemon host JSON config (e.g. tray visibility) under the app data directory.
  * Install/start/stop/status/uninstall helpers for the **openhuman** background service.


### 
`utils/dev_paths.rs`
  * Resolves `**src/openhuman/agent/prompts**`for development and bundled resource paths for AI preview.


### 
`utils/tauriSocket.ts` (frontend)
Not in `src-tauri`, but **pairs** with the shell: the React app listens for Tauri events that mirror socket activity when using the Rust-side client. See `app/src/utils/tauriSocket.ts` and the chapter.
