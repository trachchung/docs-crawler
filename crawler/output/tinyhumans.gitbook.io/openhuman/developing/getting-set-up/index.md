This guide covers the full desktop/source install path and release installers.
If you only need the repo-root Rust crate on a fresh machine, use . That page documents the pinned Rust toolchain, OS package prerequisites, and the exact `cargo` commands for `openhuman-core`.
This guide covers two paths:
  1. Build and compile OpenHuman from source
  2. Install the latest stable release binaries


## 
Prerequisites
  * `git`
  * Node.js 24 or newer (see `app/package.json`)
  * `pnpm@10.10.0` (see the root `package.json` `packageManager` field)
  * Rust 1.93.0 through `rustup` with `rustfmt` and `clippy` (see `rust-toolchain.toml`)
  * CMake, required by native Rust dependencies
  * Git submodules under `app/src-tauri/vendor/`, required for the vendored CEF-aware Tauri CLI
  * Platform desktop build tools: Xcode Command Line Tools on macOS, or the Tauri GTK/WebKit/AppIndicator package set on Linux


macOS Homebrew quick start:
Copy
```
brewinstallnode@24pnpmrustup-initcmake
rustuptoolchaininstall1.93.0--profileminimal
rustupcomponentaddrustfmtclippy--toolchain1.93.0
```

## 
Build from source (local compile)
Run from the repository root:
Copy
```
# 1) Clone and enter the repo
git clone https://github.com/tinyhumansai/openhuman.git
cd openhuman
# 2) Fetch vendored Tauri/CEF sources
git submodule update --init --recursive
# 3) Install JS deps (workspace)
pnpm install
# 4) Build Rust core binary
cargo build --manifest-path Cargo.toml --bin openhuman-core
# 5) Run the desktop staging hook (currently a no-op; kept for script compatibility)
cd app
pnpm core:stage
# 6) Build desktop app artifacts
pnpm build
```

For local development instead of production build:
Copy
```
# Web-only UI development: run inside app/ after the `cd app` step above
pnpm dev
# Desktop app development with the vendored Tauri/CEF CLI: run from the workspace root
cd ..
pnpm --filter openhuman-app dev:app
```

## 
Install latest stable release (macOS/Linux x64)
Primary install command:
Copy
```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tinyhumansai/openhuman/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

Installer behavior:
  * Resolves latest stable OpenHuman release for your platform
  * Validates artifact digest when available
  * Installs locally (no sudo by default)
  * macOS: installs `OpenHuman.app` into `~/Applications`
  * Linux x64: installs AppImage as `~/.local/bin/openhuman` and writes a desktop entry


Useful flags:
Copy
```
# Preview actions without writing files
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tinyhumansai/openhuman/main/scripts/install.sh | bash -s -- --dry-run
```

## 
Windows (latest stable)
Use PowerShell:
Copy
```
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tinyhumansai/openhuman/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

Windows installer behavior:
  * Resolves latest stable release
  * Downloads MSI/EXE for x64
  * Verifies digest when available
  * Runs per-user install where supported by installer package


## 
ARM Linux Build (aarch64)
The ARM Linux build requires special handling due to CEF and GTK dependencies.
### 
Prerequisites
Copy
```
# Install xvfb for headless builds/testing
sudo apt install xvfb
```

### 
Build
Copy
```
cd app
pnpm tauri build --target aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

### 
Running the ARM binary
The binary requires the CEF library path to be set:
### 
Option 1 - Direct invocation
Copy
```
REL_DIR=app/src-tauri/target/aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu/release
CEF_DIR=$(ls -d "$REL_DIR"/build/cef-dll-sys-*/out/cef_linux_aarch64 2>/dev/null | head -n1)
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$CEF_DIR:$REL_DIR/deps:$REL_DIR${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH}"
"$REL_DIR/OpenHuman" --no-sandbox
```

### 
Option 2 - Wrapper script (recommended)
Save to `~/bin/openhuman` and make it executable (`chmod +x ~/bin/openhuman`):
Copy
```
#!/bin/bash
REL_DIR=/path/to/app/src-tauri/target/aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu/release
CEF_DIR=$(ls -d "$REL_DIR"/build/cef-dll-sys-*/out/cef_linux_aarch64 2>/dev/null | head -n1)
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$CEF_DIR:$REL_DIR/deps:$REL_DIR${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH}"
exec "$REL_DIR/OpenHuman" --no-sandbox "$@"
```

### 
DEB package install
Copy
```
DEB_FILE=$(ls app/src-tauri/target/aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu/release/bundle/deb/OpenHuman_*_arm64.deb | head -n1)
sudo dpkg -i "$DEB_FILE"
```

### 
GTK initialization fix
The ARM build requires GTK to be initialized before Tauri creates the system tray. This is handled in `vendor/tauri-cef/crates/tauri-runtime-cef/src/lib.rs`:
Copy
```
// After CEF initialization, add:
#[cfg(target_os = "linux")]
    gtk::init().ok();

```

If the tray fails to initialize with "GTK has not been initialized", rebuild after ensuring this fix is in place.

## 
Troubleshooting
### 
macOS: `pnpm dev:app` exits with "CEF cache is held by another OpenHuman instance"
**Symptom**
`pnpm dev:app` (or any debug build of the Tauri shell) exits before the window appears with a message like:
Copy
```
[openhuman] CEF cache at /Users/<you>/Library/Caches/com.openhuman.app/cef is held by another OpenHuman instance (host <hostname>, pid 12345).
Quit the running instance and try again.
Workaround:
  pkill -f "OpenHuman.app/Contents"
  pkill -f "openhuman-core"
```

**Cause**
CEF (Chromium Embedded Framework) holds an exclusive lock on its user-data directory via a `SingletonLock` symlink under `~/Library/Caches/com.openhuman.app/cef`. Both the installed `.app` bundle and the dev binary use the same identifier (`com.openhuman.app`), so they cannot run side-by-side. Without the preflight, `cef::initialize` returns failure and the vendored `tauri-runtime-cef` panics with a Rust backtrace and no actionable message (this was issue #864 before the preflight landed).
**Fix**
Quit the other OpenHuman instance and re-run. Fastest path:
Copy
```
pkill -f "OpenHuman.app/Contents"
pkill -f "openhuman-core"
pnpm dev:app
```

If the lock is left behind by a crashed process (PID no longer alive), the preflight removes the stale `SingletonLock` automatically and dev startup proceeds, no manual cleanup required.
**Known limitation**
Dev and release builds still share `com.openhuman.app` as the cache identifier. Isolating dev to a separate `com.openhuman.app.dev` cache requires changes to the vendored `tauri-runtime-cef` (cache path is built inside the runtime from the bundle identifier, not exposed to the openhuman shell). Tracked as a follow-up to #864.
### 
Stale `openhuman` RPC process on the core port
**Symptom**
A previous Tauri build or `openhuman-core run` harness left a process listening on `OPENHUMAN_CORE_PORT` (default `7788`). Until issue #1130 the new Tauri build would silently attach to that listener, leading to version drift and 401s when the new build's `OPENHUMAN_CORE_TOKEN` didn't match.
**Current behavior (issue #1130)**
`core_process::ensure_running` now probes the port at startup:
  * If `GET /` identifies the listener as an OpenHuman core (JSON body with `"name": "openhuman"`), it is treated as a stale process from a previous run and proactively terminated (`SIGTERM`, then `SIGKILL` after 750ms on Unix; `taskkill /F /T /PID` on Windows). The Tauri host then spawns its own fresh embedded core.
  * If the listener is something else (or doesn't speak HTTP), startup fails loudly with the conflict surfaced in the log instead of silently attaching.
  * Set `OPENHUMAN_CORE_REUSE_EXISTING=1` to opt back into the legacy attach-to-anything behavior, useful when running `openhuman-core run` as a manual debugging harness.


**Manual cleanup (still works)**
Copy
```
pkill -f "OpenHuman.app/Contents"
pkill -f "openhuman-core"
```
