OpenHuman can run a local model on your machine for the workloads where keeping data on-device matters most: **memory embeddings, summary-tree building, and background reasoning loops**. It is **opt-in** and ships **off** by default.
This is a deliberate scoping. The previous design tried to put chat, vision, STT and TTS all on-device with Gemma 3, and the result was a heavy, hardware-sensitive footprint that fought with what the rest of the product needed to be. Today, the things that benefit most from being local (recurring, low-latency, privacy-sensitive memory work) run local; the things that benefit most from frontier models (chat, reasoning, vision) stay cloud.
## 
What runs local when you turn it on
Workload
Default model
Implementation
**Memory embeddings**
`all-minilm:latest`
`src/openhuman/embeddings/ollama.rs` - used by the for vector search.
**Summary-tree building**
`gemma3:1b-it-qat` (configurable)
`src/openhuman/tree_summarizer/ops.rs` - source / topic / global summary builders for the Memory Tree.
**Heartbeat loop**
small chat model
`src/openhuman/heartbeat/` - periodic background reflection.
**Learning / reflection**
small chat model
`src/openhuman/learning/reflection.rs` - passes that consolidate what was learned.
**Subconscious**
small chat model
`src/openhuman/subconscious/executor.rs` - background evaluation loop.
Each of these is a **per-feature opt-in flag**. Turning on local AI does not silently route everything through it, you choose the workloads.
## 
What stays in the cloud
Workload
Why cloud
**Chat (default)**
Frontier reasoning quality. Routed via the under one subscription.
**Vision**
Same.
**STT**
Backend-proxied transcription (`src/openhuman/voice/cloud_transcribe.rs`).
**TTS**
Hosted under the hood (`reply_speech.rs`).
**Web search**
Backend proxy (no API key on your machine).
For **lightweight or medium chat hints** (`hint:reaction`, `hint:classify`, `hint:format`, `hint:sentiment`, `hint:summarize`, `hint:medium`, `hint:tool_lite`), the will prefer the local provider when local AI is enabled and Ollama is reachable. Heavy hints (`hint:reasoning`, `hint:agentic`, `hint:coding`) stay cloud.
## 
How it works
Under the hood, OpenHuman uses [Ollamaarrow-up-right](https://ollama.com) and talks to it over Ollama's OpenAI-compatible `/v1` endpoint. That means:
  * The `OpenAiCompatibleProvider` (`src/openhuman/providers/compatible.rs`) wraps Ollama exactly the way it wraps a remote OpenAI-style provider. No special-case code path.
  * The provider router creates a _health-gated_ local provider on startup. If Ollama is not reachable, requests transparently fall back to the remote provider, no broken state.
  * Models are pulled on demand by Ollama and cached in its own store. OpenHuman doesn't ship the weights itself.


## 
Opting in
Local AI is gated by two flags in the core config (`src/openhuman/config/schema/local_ai.rs`):
Flag
Default
Meaning
`local_ai.runtime_enabled`
`false`
Master switch. `false` ⇒ no local provider is created at all.
`local_ai.opt_in_confirmed`
`false`
Explicit opt-in marker. Bootstrap forces `false` unless you re-opt.
`local_ai.usage.embeddings`
`false`
Use local for memory embeddings.
`local_ai.usage.heartbeat`
`false`
Use local for the heartbeat loop.
`local_ai.usage.learning_reflection`
`false`
Use local for learning passes.
`local_ai.usage.subconscious`
`false`
Use local for the subconscious loop.
In the desktop app, **Settings → AI & Skills → Local AI** exposes presets, pick one ("embeddings only", "memory + reflection", "everything local") and the right combination of flags is set for you. Status (Ollama reachability, model availability, per-subsystem enablement) is surfaced live via `openhuman.local_ai_status`.
## 
When to turn it on
Local AI is worth turning on if any of these are true:
  * You ingest large volumes of email / chat and want **embeddings to never leave the machine**.
  * You want **summary-tree building** to work offline.
  * You're privacy-sensitive about background reflection ("subconscious") loops.


It is **not** worth turning on if you only have a few sources connected, the cloud path is faster and the privacy benefit is small. There is also a hardware cost: Ollama and a small Gemma model want a few GB of RAM and pull a few GB of weights.
## 
What you'll need
  * [**Ollama** arrow-up-right](https://ollama.com) installed and running locally.
  * Enough disk for the models (`gemma3:1b-it-qat` ~700 MB, `all-minilm:latest` ~23 MB).
  * Enough RAM to keep the model resident (8 GB+ recommended, 16 GB+ ideal).


OpenHuman handles the rest: lifecycle (`src/openhuman/local_ai/service.rs`), API client (`ollama_api.rs`), health checks, and graceful fallback to remote when Ollama disappears.
