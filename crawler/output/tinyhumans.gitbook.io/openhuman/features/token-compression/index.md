LLM tokens are expensive, and verbose tool output is where most of them go to die. A `git status` in a busy repo, a `cargo build` log, a 600-message email thread, a `docker ps -a` against a real cluster, each of these can balloon a context window for almost no information gain.
OpenHuman ships with **TokenJuice** , a port of [vincentkoc/tokenjuicearrow-up-right](https://github.com/vincentkoc/tokenjuice) integrated directly into the tool-execution path. Before any tool result reaches the model, TokenJuice runs the output through a rule overlay that strips the noise and keeps the signal.
## 
Three-layer rule overlay
Rules are JSON, and they merge in this order, later layers override earlier ones:
Layer
Path
Purpose
**Builtin**
shipped with the binary
sensible defaults for git, npm, cargo, docker, kubectl, ls, etc.
**User**
`~/.config/tokenjuice/rules/`
your personal overrides, apply across every project
**Project**
`.tokenjuice/rules/`
repo-specific overrides, checked in, shared with the team
Each rule names a tool/command pattern and a reduction strategy (truncate, dedup lines, fold whitespace, drop matching regexes, summarize sections, …). New rules are just JSON files; no recompile required.
## 
Why this matters for memory
TokenJuice is what makes economically viable. When the Gmail provider syncs a page of 200 messages, TokenJuice compacts each canonicalized email _before_ it enters the model that builds summaries. The same applies to GitHub diffs, Slack channel dumps, and any other firehose source.
Concretely: ingesting your last six months of email through a frontier model costs single-digit dollars instead of hundreds.
## 
Where it lives in the pipeline
Copy
```
tool call result
TokenJuice (classify → match rule → reduce)
LLM context
```

Implementation: `src/openhuman/tokenjuice/` (`classify.rs`, `reduce.rs`, `rules/compiler.rs`, `tool_integration.rs`).
## 
Inspecting and overriding
  * Drop a JSON file in `~/.config/tokenjuice/rules/` to add or override a rule globally.
  * Drop one in `.tokenjuice/rules/` inside a repo to do the same per-project.
  * Start the core with `RUST_LOG=openhuman_core::openhuman::tokenjuice=debug` to see what's matching and how much output is being trimmed.
