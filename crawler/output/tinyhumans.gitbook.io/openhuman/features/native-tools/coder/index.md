The coder family is what makes OpenHuman a viable coding partner instead of a chat window that _pretends_ to know the codebase.
## 
Tools in the family
Tool
What it does
`file_read`
Read a file (with line numbers, like `cat -n`).
`file_write`
Write a new file.
`edit_file`
Targeted edits - match-and-replace with strict uniqueness checks.
`apply_patch`
Apply a unified diff.
`glob_search`
Find files by glob pattern.
`grep`
Ripgrep-style search across the tree.
`list_files`
Walk a directory tree.
`read_diff`
Diff between two files or revisions.
`git_operations`
Status, diff, log, blame, branch, commit.
`run_linter`
Run the project's linter.
`run_tests`
Run the project's test command.
`csv_export`
Export query results as CSV.
## 
Why these are native, not shell-only
A shell tool plus `cat`/`sed`/`awk` could _technically_ do all of this. The native tools exist because:
  * Edits go through a uniqueness check, so the agent can't accidentally clobber the wrong line.
  * Reads come back with line numbers the agent can refer to in follow-ups.
  * Git operations parse output into structured data, instead of leaving the agent to scrape porcelain.
  * Lint and test runs are wired to the project's actual commands, not generic guesses.


## 
Workspace scoping
Filesystem tools respect a workspace boundary - the agent can't read or write outside it without explicit permission. Same boundary the rest of the app uses for `OPENHUMAN_WORKSPACE`.
## 
See also
  * - `shell`, `node_exec`, `npm_exec` for the rest of the dev loop.
  * - `todo_write`, `spawn_subagent` for larger refactors.
