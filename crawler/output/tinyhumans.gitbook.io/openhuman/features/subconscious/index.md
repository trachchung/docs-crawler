A background task evaluation and execution system. On a periodic tick, it loads a list of user-defined and system tasks, reads the current state of your workspace, decides what to do about each one, and either acts autonomously or escalates to you for approval.
Think of it as the agent's idle thread: the part that keeps thinking after you've stopped typing.
## 
How a tick works
Copy
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    Heartbeat                            │
│           (sleeps a few minutes between ticks)          │
└──────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────┘
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                  Subconscious Engine                    │
│                                                         │
│  1. Load due tasks                                      │
│  2. Mark each one in-progress                           │
│  3. Build a situation report (memory + workspace)       │
│  4. Evaluate every task with the local model            │
│  5. Execute the decision (act / noop / escalate)        │
│  6. Write the outcome back to the activity log          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
           ┌───────────┼───────────┐
           ▼           ▼           ▼
         noop         act       escalate
        (skip)    (execute)   (deeper agent)
```

Each tick is independent. If a tick is still running when the next one starts (slow model call, network blip), the new tick takes over and the old one's in-progress entries are marked cancelled. Ticks never stack.
## 
Task types
### 
System tasks
Seeded automatically when the engine starts. Cannot be deleted, only disabled. The defaults cover things you'd want any assistant watching for:
  * Check connected skills for errors or disconnections
  * Review new memory updates for actionable items
  * Monitor system health (local model, memory, connections)


You can extend the system task set by listing additional ones in a `HEARTBEAT.md` file in your workspace, one task per line.
### 
User tasks
Anything you add manually from the UI. Toggle on/off, edit, delete. Examples:
  * "Check urgent emails" (read-only)
  * "Send daily summary to Slack" (write intent)
  * "Summarize Notion updates" (read-only)


## 
Decisions
For every due task, the local model returns one of three decisions:
Decision
Meaning
Skip
Nothing relevant right now
Act
Something relevant found, execute the task
Escalate
Needs deeper reasoning, hand off to the cloud agent
How that decision gets executed depends on whether the task has **write intent** (it asks the agent to take an action) or is **read-only** (it asks the agent to look and report):
Copy
```
Decision: Skip
  → Log "nothing new", schedule the next run
Decision: Act
  → Execute on the local model (read or write)
Decision: Escalate
  ├─ Write-intent task
  │   → Run the cloud agent with full permissions
  │   → No approval needed (you explicitly asked for the action)
  └─ Read-only task
      → Run the cloud agent in analysis-only mode
      → If the agent surfaces an unsolicited recommended action
      │   → Create an escalation card for your approval
      │   → On approval → re-run with full permissions
      └─ Otherwise → log result, done
```

Every task evaluation lands in the activity log with a colored dot and a short status:
State
Color
Text
In progress
Blue (pulsing)
"Evaluating…"
Acted
Green
Result text
Skipped
Gray
"Nothing new"
Awaiting approval
Amber
"Waiting for approval"
Failed
Coral
Error message
Cancelled
Gray
"Cancelled"
Dismissed
Gray
"Skipped"
## 
Two models, one loop
Stage
Where it runs
Why
Per-task evaluation (every tick)
Local model (Ollama)
Free, no rate limit, fine on-device
Text-only execution (summarize, check)
Local model
Same
Tool-using execution (send, post, …)
Cloud agent
Tools, larger context, retries on rate-limit
Analysis mode for escalated reads
Cloud agent (read-only)
Deeper reasoning when the local model defers
The split keeps the loop cheap: you only pay for cloud calls when a task actually needs them.
## 
Approval gate
Approval is only required when the agent wants to take a **write action that you didn't explicitly ask for**.
Task intent
Agent wants to write
Approval needed?
"Send digest to Slack" (write)
Yes
No, you asked for it
"Check urgent emails" (read)
No
No, read-only result
"Check urgent emails" (read)
Yes (forward them)
**Yes** , unsolicited write
The approval flow:
  1. The cloud agent runs in analysis-only mode.
  2. It surfaces a recommendation, e.g. _"forward 3 urgent emails to #team-alerts."_
  3. An escalation card appears in the UI under **Approval Needed**.
  4. **Go ahead** re-runs with full permissions.
  5. **Skip** does nothing.


Skill-related escalations (broken integration, expired OAuth, missing scope) show a **Fix in Skills** button that takes you straight to the Skills page instead.
## 
Failure handling
A failure counter tracks consecutive ticks where the whole evaluation step failed (local model down, network out). It resets to zero on any successful tick and shows up in the UI status bar in coral when non-zero.
Per-task failures don't trip this counter, the tick itself is still considered successful.
If a tick fails or is cancelled, the engine doesn't advance its "last seen" timestamp, so the next successful tick covers the same window. Nothing in your workspace gets skipped.
## 
Configuration
The loop is configurable in the desktop app:
  * **Enable / disable.** Turn the entire background loop on or off.
  * **Tick interval.** How often a tick fires. Defaults to 5 minutes; that's also the minimum.
  * **Inference.** Whether the local model evaluates tasks each tick. Disable this if you'd rather only run things via the manual **Run Now** button.
  * **Context budget.** How much of the workspace situation report can be passed in at once. The default is sane; raise it for richer context, lower it for tighter cost.


## 
In the UI
Lives under **Intelligence → Subconscious**.
  * **Status bar.** Task count, total ticks, last tick time, failure counter (if any).
  * **Active Tasks.** System tasks (read-only, with a "default" badge) and your own tasks (toggle + delete).
  * **Approval Needed.** Amber cards for pending escalations. Each has a title, description, and priority. Buttons: **Go ahead** , **Fix in Skills** (when relevant), or **Skip**.
  * **Activity Log.** Chronological feed of every task evaluation, colored dot + result. Auto-refreshes while anything is in progress.
  * **Run Now.** Manually trigger a tick. Returns immediately; the UI polls for the result.
