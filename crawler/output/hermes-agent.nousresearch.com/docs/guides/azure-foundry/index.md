Hermes Agent supports Azure AI Foundry (and Azure OpenAI) as a first-class provider. A single Azure resource can host models with two different wire formats:
  * **OpenAI-style** — `POST /v1/chat/completions` on endpoints like `https://<resource>.openai.azure.com/openai/v1`. Used for GPT-4.x, GPT-5.x, Llama, Mistral, and most open-weight models.
  * **Anthropic-style** — `POST /v1/messages` on endpoints like `https://<resource>.services.ai.azure.com/anthropic`. Used when Azure Foundry serves Claude models via the Anthropic Messages API format.


The setup wizard probes your endpoint and auto-detects which transport it uses, which deployments are available, and each model's context length.
## Prerequisites[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/guides/azure-foundry#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")
  * An Azure AI Foundry or Azure OpenAI resource with at least one deployment
  * An API key for that resource (available in the Azure Portal under "Keys and Endpoint")
  * The deployment's endpoint URL


## Quick Start[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/guides/azure-foundry#quick-start "Direct link to Quick Start")

```
hermes model# → Select "Azure Foundry"# → Enter your endpoint URL# → Enter your API key# Hermes probes the endpoint and auto-detects transport + models# → Pick a model from the list (or type a deployment name manually)
```

The wizard will:
  1. **Sniff the URL path** — URLs ending in `/anthropic` are recognised as Azure Foundry Claude routes.
  2. **Probe`GET <base>/models`** — if the endpoint returns an OpenAI-shaped model list, Hermes switches to `chat_completions` and prefills a picker with the returned deployment IDs.
  3. **Probe Anthropic Messages shape** — fallback for endpoints that do not expose `/models` but do accept the Anthropic Messages format.
  4. **Fall back to manual entry** — private/gated endpoints that reject every probe still work; you pick the API mode and type a deployment name by hand.


Context length for the chosen model is resolved via Hermes' standard metadata chain (`models.dev`, provider metadata, and hardcoded family fallbacks) and stored in `config.yaml` so the model can size its own context window correctly.
## Configuration (written to `config.yaml`)[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/guides/azure-foundry#configuration-written-to-configyaml "Direct link to configuration-written-to-configyaml")
After running the wizard you'll see something like this:

```
model:provider: azure-foundrybase_url: https://my-resource.openai.azure.com/openai/v1api_mode: chat_completions         # or "anthropic_messages"default: gpt-5.4-mini              # your deployment / model namecontext_length:400000# auto-detected
```

And in `~/.hermes/.env`:

```
AZURE_FOUNDRY_API_KEY=<your-azure-key>
```

## OpenAI-style endpoints (GPT, Llama, etc.)[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/guides/azure-foundry#openai-style-endpoints-gpt-llama-etc "Direct link to OpenAI-style endpoints \(GPT, Llama, etc.\)")
Azure OpenAI's v1 GA endpoint accepts the standard `openai` Python client with minimal changes:

```
model:provider: azure-foundrybase_url: https://my-resource.openai.azure.com/openai/v1api_mode: chat_completionsdefault: gpt-5.4
```

Important behaviour:
  * **GPT-5.x, codex, and o-series auto-route to the Responses API.** Azure Foundry deploys GPT-5 / codex / o1 / o3 / o4 models as Responses-API-only — calling `/chat/completions` against them returns `400 "The requested operation is unsupported."`. Hermes detects these model families by name and upgrades `api_mode` to `codex_responses` transparently, even when `config.yaml` still reads `api_mode: chat_completions`. GPT-4, GPT-4o, Llama, Mistral, and other deployments stay on `/chat/completions`.
  * **`max_completion_tokens`is used automatically.** Azure OpenAI (like direct OpenAI) requires `max_completion_tokens` for gpt-4o, o-series, and gpt-5.x models. Hermes sends the right parameter based on the endpoint.
  * **Pre-v1 endpoints that require`api-version`.** If you have a legacy base URL like `https://<resource>.openai.azure.com/openai?api-version=2025-04-01-preview`, Hermes extracts the query string and forwards it via `default_query` on every request (the OpenAI SDK otherwise drops it when joining paths).


## Anthropic-style endpoints (Claude via Azure Foundry)[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/guides/azure-foundry#anthropic-style-endpoints-claude-via-azure-foundry "Direct link to Anthropic-style endpoints \(Claude via Azure Foundry\)")
For Claude deployments, use the Anthropic-style route:

```
model:provider: azure-foundrybase_url: https://my-resource.services.ai.azure.com/anthropicapi_mode: anthropic_messagesdefault: claude-sonnet-4-6
```

Important behaviour:
  * **`/v1`is stripped from the base URL.** The Anthropic SDK appends `/v1/messages` to every request URL — Hermes removes any trailing `/v1` before handing the URL to the SDK to avoid double-`/v1` paths.
  * **`api-version`is sent via`default_query` , not appended to the URL.** Azure Anthropic requires an `api-version` query string. Baking it into the base URL produces malformed paths like `/anthropic?api-version=.../v1/messages` and returns 404. Hermes passes `api-version=2025-04-15` via the Anthropic SDK's `default_query` instead.
  * **OAuth token refresh is disabled.** Azure deployments use static API keys. The `~/.claude/.credentials.json` OAuth token refresh loop that applies to Anthropic Console is explicitly skipped for Azure endpoints to prevent the Claude Code OAuth token from overwriting your Azure key mid-session.


## Alternative: `provider: anthropic` + Azure base URL[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/guides/azure-foundry#alternative-provider-anthropic--azure-base-url "Direct link to alternative-provider-anthropic--azure-base-url")
If you already have `provider: anthropic` configured and just want to point it at Azure AI Foundry for Claude, you can skip the `azure-foundry` provider entirely:

```
model:provider: anthropicbase_url: https://my-resource.services.ai.azure.com/anthropickey_env: AZURE_ANTHROPIC_KEYdefault: claude-sonnet-4-6
```

With `AZURE_ANTHROPIC_KEY` set in `~/.hermes/.env`. Hermes detects `azure.com` in the base URL and short-circuits around the Claude Code OAuth token chain so the Azure key is used directly with `x-api-key` auth.
`key_env` is the canonical snake_case field name; `api_key_env` (and the camelCase `keyEnv` / `apiKeyEnv`) are accepted as aliases. If both `key_env` and `AZURE_ANTHROPIC_KEY`/`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` are set, the `key_env`-named env var wins.
## Model discovery[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/guides/azure-foundry#model-discovery "Direct link to Model discovery")
Azure does **not** expose a pure-API-key endpoint to list your _deployed_ model deployments. Deployment enumeration requires Azure Resource Manager authentication (`az cognitiveservices account deployment list`) with an Azure AD principal, not the inference API key.
What Hermes can do:
  * Azure OpenAI v1 endpoints (`<resource>.openai.azure.com/openai/v1`) expose `GET /models` with the resource's **available** model catalog. Hermes uses this list to prefill the model picker.
  * Azure Foundry `/anthropic` routes: detected via URL path, model name entered manually.
  * Private / firewalled endpoints: manual entry with a friendly "couldn't probe" message.


You can always type a deployment name directly — Hermes does not validate against the returned list.
## Environment variables[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/guides/azure-foundry#environment-variables "Direct link to Environment variables")  
| Variable  | Purpose  |  
| --- | --- |  
| `AZURE_FOUNDRY_API_KEY`  | Primary API key for Azure AI Foundry / Azure OpenAI  |  
| `AZURE_FOUNDRY_BASE_URL`  | Endpoint URL (set via `hermes model`; env var is used as a fallback)  |  
| `AZURE_ANTHROPIC_KEY`  | Used by `provider: anthropic` + Azure base URL (alternative to `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`)  |  
## Troubleshooting[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/guides/azure-foundry#troubleshooting "Direct link to Troubleshooting")
**401 Unauthorized on gpt-5.x deployments.** Azure serves gpt-5.x on `/chat/completions`, not `/responses`. Hermes handles this automatically when the URL contains `openai.azure.com`, but if you see a 401 with an `Invalid API key` body, check that `api_mode` in your `config.yaml` is `chat_completions`.
**404 on`/v1/messages?api-version=.../v1/messages`.** This is the malformed-URL bug from pre-fix Azure Anthropic setups. Upgrade Hermes — the `api-version` parameter is now passed via `default_query` rather than baked into the base URL, so the SDK can't corrupt it during URL joining.
**Wizard says "Auto-detection incomplete."** The endpoint rejected both the `/models` probe and the Anthropic Messages probe. This is normal for private endpoints behind a firewall or with an IP allow-list. Fall back to manual API mode selection and type your deployment name — everything still works, Hermes just can't prefill the picker.
**Wrong transport picked.** Run `hermes model` again and the wizard will re-probe. If the probe still picks the wrong mode, you can edit `config.yaml` directly:

```
model:provider: azure-foundryapi_mode: anthropic_messages   # or chat_completions
```
