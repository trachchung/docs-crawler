The curator is a background maintenance pass for **agent-created skills**. It tracks how often each skill is viewed, used, and patched, moves long-unused skills through `active → stale → archived` states, and periodically spawns a short auxiliary-model review that proposes consolidations or patches drift.
It exists so that skills created via the [self-improvement loop](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/skills#agent-managed-skills-skill_manage-tool) don't pile up forever. Every time the agent solves a novel problem and saves a skill, that skill lands in `~/.hermes/skills/`. Without maintenance, you end up with dozens of narrow near-duplicates that pollute the catalog and waste tokens.
The curator **never touches** bundled skills (shipped with the repo) or hub-installed skills (from [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io)). It only reviews skills the agent itself authored. It also **never auto-deletes** — the worst outcome is archival into `~/.hermes/skills/.archive/`, which is recoverable.
Tracks [issue #7816](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/issues/7816).
## How it runs[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/curator#how-it-runs "Direct link to How it runs")
The curator is triggered by an inactivity check, not a cron daemon. On CLI session start, and on a recurring tick inside the gateway's cron-ticker thread, Hermes checks whether:
  1. Enough time has passed since the last curator run (`interval_hours`, default **7 days**), and
  2. The agent has been idle long enough (`min_idle_hours`, default **2 hours**).


If both are true, it spawns a background fork of `AIAgent` — the same pattern used by the memory/skill self-improvement nudges. The fork runs in its own prompt cache and never touches the active conversation.
On a brand-new install (or the first time a pre-curator install ticks after `hermes update`), the curator **does not run immediately**. The first observation seeds `last_run_at` to "now" and defers the first real pass by one full `interval_hours`. This gives you a full interval to review your skill library, pin anything important, or opt out entirely before the curator ever touches it.
If you want to see what the curator _would_ do before it runs for real, run `hermes curator run --dry-run` — it produces the same review report without mutating the library.
A run has two phases:
  1. **Automatic transitions** (deterministic, no LLM). Skills unused for `stale_after_days` (30) become `stale`; skills unused for `archive_after_days` (90) are moved to `~/.hermes/skills/.archive/`.
  2. **LLM review** (single aux-model pass, `max_iterations=8`). The forked agent surveys the agent-created skills, can read any of them with `skill_view`, and decides per-skill whether to keep, patch (via `skill_manage`), consolidate overlapping ones, or archive via the terminal tool.


Pinned skills are off-limits to both the curator's auto-transitions and the agent's own `skill_manage` tool. See [Pinning a skill](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/curator#pinning-a-skill) below.
## Configuration[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/curator#configuration "Direct link to Configuration")
All settings live in `config.yaml` under `curator:` (not `.env` — this isn't a secret). Defaults:

```
curator:enabled:trueinterval_hours:168# 7 daysmin_idle_hours:2stale_after_days:30archive_after_days:90
```

To disable entirely, set `curator.enabled: false`.
### Running the review on a cheaper aux model[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/curator#running-the-review-on-a-cheaper-aux-model "Direct link to Running the review on a cheaper aux model")
The curator's LLM review pass is a regular auxiliary task slot — `auxiliary.curator` — alongside Vision, Compression, Session Search, etc. "Auto" means "use my main chat model"; override the slot to pin a specific provider + model for the review pass instead.
**Easiest —`hermes model` :**

```
hermes model                   # → "Auxiliary models — side-task routing"# → pick "Curator" → pick provider → pick model
```

The same picker is available in the web dashboard under the **Models** tab.
**Direct config.yaml (equivalent):**

```
auxiliary:curator:provider: openroutermodel: google/gemini-3-flash-previewtimeout:600# generous — reviews can take several minutes
```

Leaving `provider: auto` (the default) routes the review pass through whatever your main chat model is, matching the behavior of every other auxiliary task.
Earlier releases used a one-off `curator.auxiliary.{provider,model}` block. That path still works but emits a deprecation log line — please migrate to `auxiliary.curator` above so the curator shares the same plumbing (`hermes model`, dashboard Models tab, `base_url`, `api_key`, `timeout`, `extra_body`) as every other aux task.
## CLI[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/curator#cli "Direct link to CLI")

```

## Backups and rollback[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/curator#backups-and-rollback "Direct link to Backups and rollback")
Before every real curator pass, Hermes takes a tar.gz snapshot of `~/.hermes/skills/` at `~/.hermes/skills/.curator_backups/<utc-iso>/skills.tar.gz`. If a pass archives or consolidates something you didn't want touched, you can undo the whole run with one command:

```
hermes curator rollback        # restore newest snapshot (with confirmation)hermes curator rollback -y# skip the prompthermes curator rollback --list# see all snapshots with reason + size
```

The rollback itself is reversible: before replacing the skills tree, Hermes takes another snapshot tagged `pre-rollback to <target-id>`, so a mistaken rollback can be undone by rolling forward to that one with `--id`.
You can also take manual snapshots at any time with `hermes curator backup --reason "before-refactor"`. The `--reason` string lands in the snapshot's `manifest.json` and is shown in `--list`.
Snapshots are pruned to `curator.backup.keep` (default 5) to keep disk usage bounded:

```
curator:backup:enabled:truekeep:5
```

Set `curator.backup.enabled: false` to disable automatic snapshotting. The manual `hermes curator backup` command still works when backups are disabled only if you set `enabled: true` first — the flag gates both paths symmetrically so there's no way to accidentally skip the pre-run snapshot on mutating runs.
`hermes curator status` also lists the five least-recently-used skills — a quick way to see what's likely to become stale next.
The same subcommands are available as the `/curator` slash command inside a running session (CLI or gateway platforms).
## What "agent-created" means[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/curator#what-agent-created-means "Direct link to What "agent-created" means")
A skill is considered agent-created if its name is **not** in:
  * `~/.hermes/skills/.bundled_manifest` (skills copied from the repo on install), and
  * `~/.hermes/skills/.hub/lock.json` (skills installed via `hermes skills install`).


Everything else in `~/.hermes/skills/` is fair game for the curator. This includes:
  * Skills the agent saved via `skill_manage(action="create")` during a conversation.
  * Skills you created manually with a hand-written `SKILL.md`.
  * Skills added via external skill directories you've pointed Hermes at.


Provenance here is **binary** (bundled/hub vs. everything else). The curator cannot tell a hand-authored skill you rely on for private workflows apart from a skill the self-improvement loop saved mid-session. Both land in the "agent-created" bucket.
Before the first real pass (7 days after installation by default), take a moment to:
  1. Run `hermes curator run --dry-run` to see exactly what the curator would propose.
  2. Use `hermes curator pin <name>` to fence off anything you don't want touched.
  3. Or set `curator.enabled: false` in `config.yaml` if you'd rather manage the library yourself.


Archives are always recoverable via `hermes curator restore <name>`, but it's easier to pin up-front than to chase down a consolidation after the fact.
If you want to protect a specific skill from ever being touched — for example a hand-authored skill you rely on — use `hermes curator pin <name>`. See the next section.
## Pinning a skill[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/curator#pinning-a-skill "Direct link to Pinning a skill")
Pinning protects a skill from deletion — both the curator's automated archive passes and the agent's `skill_manage(action="delete")` tool call. Once a skill is pinned:
  * The **curator** skips it during auto-transitions (`active → stale → archived`), and its LLM review pass is instructed to leave it alone.
  * The **agent's`skill_manage` tool** refuses `delete` on it, pointing the user at `hermes curator unpin <name>`. Patches and edits still go through, so the agent can improve a pinned skill's content as pitfalls come up without a pin/unpin/re-pin dance.


Pin and unpin with:

```
hermes curator pin <skill>hermes curator unpin <skill>
```

The flag is stored as `"pinned": true` on the skill's entry in `~/.hermes/skills/.usage.json`, so it survives across sessions.
Only **agent-created** skills can be pinned — bundled and hub-installed skills are never subject to curator mutation in the first place, and `hermes curator pin` will refuse with an explanatory message if you try.
If you want a stronger guarantee than "no deletion" — for instance, freezing a skill's content entirely while the agent still reads it — edit `~/.hermes/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` directly with your editor. The pin guards tool-driven deletion, not your own filesystem access.
## Usage telemetry[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/curator#usage-telemetry "Direct link to Usage telemetry")
The curator maintains a sidecar at `~/.hermes/skills/.usage.json` with one entry per skill:

```
"my-skill":{"use_count":12,"view_count":34,"last_used_at":"2026-04-24T18:12:03Z","last_viewed_at":"2026-04-23T09:44:17Z","patch_count":3,"last_patched_at":"2026-04-20T22:01:55Z","created_at":"2026-03-01T14:20:00Z","state":"active","pinned":false,"archived_at":null
```

Counters increment when:
  * `view_count`: the agent calls `skill_view` on the skill.
  * `use_count`: the skill is loaded into a conversation's prompt.
  * `patch_count`: `skill_manage patch/edit/write_file/remove_file` runs on the skill.


Bundled and hub-installed skills are explicitly excluded from telemetry writes.
## Per-run reports[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/curator#per-run-reports "Direct link to Per-run reports")
Every curator run writes a timestamped directory under `~/.hermes/logs/curator/`:

```
~/.hermes/logs/curator/└── 20260429-111512/    ├── run.json      # machine-readable: full fidelity, stats, LLM output    └── REPORT.md     # human-readable summary
```

`REPORT.md` is a quick way to see what a given run did — which skills transitioned, what the LLM reviewer said, which skills it patched. Good for auditing without having to grep `agent.log`.
## Restoring an archived skill[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/curator#restoring-an-archived-skill "Direct link to Restoring an archived skill")
If the curator archived something you still want:

```
hermes curator restore <skill-name>
```

This moves the skill back from `~/.hermes/skills/.archive/` to the active tree and resets its state to `active`. The restore refuses if a bundled or hub-installed skill has since been installed under the same name (would shadow upstream).
## Disabling per environment[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/curator#disabling-per-environment "Direct link to Disabling per environment")
The curator is on by default. To turn it off:
  * **For one profile only:** edit `~/.hermes/config.yaml` (or the active profile's config) and set `curator.enabled: false`.
  * **For just one run:** `hermes curator pause` — the pause persists across sessions; use `resume` to re-enable.


The curator also refuses to run if `min_idle_hours` hasn't elapsed, so on an active dev machine it naturally only runs during quiet stretches.
