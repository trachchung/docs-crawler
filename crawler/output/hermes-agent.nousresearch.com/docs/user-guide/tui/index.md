The TUI is the modern front-end for Hermes — a terminal UI backed by the same Python runtime as the [Classic CLI](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/cli). Same agent, same sessions, same slash commands; a cleaner, more responsive surface for interacting with them.
It's the recommended way to run Hermes interactively.
## Launch[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/tui#launch "Direct link to Launch")

```
# Launch the TUIhermes --tui# Resume the latest TUI session (falls back to the latest classic session)hermes --tui-chermes --tui--continue# Resume a specific session by ID or titlehermes --tui-r 20260409_000000_aa11bbhermes --tui--resume"my t0p session"# Run source directly — skips the prebuild step (for TUI contributors)hermes --tui--dev
```

You can also enable it via env var:

```
exportHERMES_TUI=1hermes          # now uses the TUIhermes chat     # same
```

The classic CLI remains available as the default. Anything documented in [CLI Interface](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/cli) — slash commands, quick commands, skill preloading, personalities, multi-line input, interrupts — works in the TUI identically.
## Why the TUI[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/tui#why-the-tui "Direct link to Why the TUI")
  * **Instant first frame** — the banner paints before the app finishes loading, so the terminal never feels frozen while Hermes is starting.
  * **Non-blocking input** — type and queue messages before the session is ready. Your first prompt sends the moment the agent comes online.
  * **Rich overlays** — model picker, session picker, approval and clarification prompts all render as modal panels rather than inline flows.
  * **Live session panel** — tools and skills fill in progressively as they initialize.
  * **Mouse-friendly selection** — drag to highlight with a uniform background instead of SGR inverse. Copy with your terminal's normal copy gesture.
  * **Alternate-screen rendering** — differential updates mean no flicker when streaming, no scrollback clutter after you quit.
  * **Composer affordances** — inline paste-collapse for long snippets, `Cmd+V` / `Ctrl+V` text paste with clipboard-image fallback, bracketed-paste safety, and image/file-path attachment normalization.


Same [skins](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/skins) and [personalities](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/personality) apply. Switch mid-session with `/skin ares`, `/personality pirate`, and the UI repaints live. See [Skins & Themes](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/skins) for the full list of customizable keys and which ones apply to classic vs TUI — the TUI honors the banner palette, UI colors, prompt glyph/color, session display, completion menu, selection bg, `tool_prefix`, and `help_header`.
## Requirements[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/tui#requirements "Direct link to Requirements")
  * **Node.js** ≥ 20 — the TUI runs as a subprocess launched from the Python CLI. `hermes doctor` verifies this.
  * **TTY** — like the classic CLI, piping stdin or running in non-interactive environments falls back to single-query mode.


On first launch Hermes installs the TUI's Node dependencies into `ui-tui/node_modules` (one-time, a few seconds). Subsequent launches are fast. If you pull a new Hermes version, the TUI bundle is rebuilt automatically when sources are newer than the dist.
### External prebuild[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/tui#external-prebuild "Direct link to External prebuild")
Distributions that ship a prebuilt bundle (Nix, system packages) can point Hermes at it:

```
exportHERMES_TUI_DIR=/path/to/prebuilt/ui-tuihermes --tui
```

The directory must contain `dist/entry.js`.
## Keybindings[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/tui#keybindings "Direct link to Keybindings")
Keybindings match the [Classic CLI](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/cli#keybindings) exactly. The only behavioral differences:
  * **Mouse drag** highlights text with a uniform selection background.
  * **`Cmd+V`/`Ctrl+V`** first tries normal text paste, then falls back to OSC52/native clipboard reads, and finally image attach when the clipboard or pasted payload resolves to an image.
  * **`/terminal-setup`**installs local VS Code / Cursor / Windsurf terminal bindings for better`Cmd+Enter` and undo/redo parity on macOS.
  * **Slash autocompletion** opens as a floating panel with descriptions, not an inline dropdown.
  * **`Ctrl+X`**— when a queued message is highlighted (sent while the agent was still running), delete it from the queue.**`Esc`**cancels editing and unhighlights without deleting.
  * **`Ctrl+G`/`Ctrl+X Ctrl+E`** — open the current input buffer in `$EDITOR` for multi-line / long-prompt composition; save-and-exit sends the contents back as the prompt.


## Slash commands[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/tui#slash-commands "Direct link to Slash commands")
All slash commands work unchanged. A few are TUI-owned — they produce richer output or render as overlays rather than inline panels:  
| Command  | TUI behavior  |  
| --- | --- |  
| `/help`  | Overlay with categorized commands, arrow-key navigable  |  
| `/sessions`  | Modal session picker — preview, title, token totals, resume inline  |  
| `/model`  | Modal model picker grouped by provider, with cost hints  |  
| `/skin`  | Live preview — theme change applies as you browse  |  
| `/details`  | Toggle verbose tool-call details (global or per-section)  |  
| `/usage`  | Rich token / cost / context panel  |  
|  `/agents` (alias `/tasks`)  | Observability overlay — live subagent tree with kill/pause controls, per-branch cost / token / file rollups, turn-by-turn history  |  
| `/reload`  | Re-reads `~/.hermes/.env` into the running TUI process so newly added API keys take effect without a restart  |  
| `/mouse`  | Toggle mouse tracking on/off at runtime (also persists to `display.mouse_tracking` in `config.yaml`)  |  
Every other slash command (including installed skills, quick commands, and personality toggles) works identically to the classic CLI. See [Slash Commands Reference](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/reference/slash-commands).
## LaTeX math rendering[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/tui#latex-math-rendering "Direct link to LaTeX math rendering")
The TUI's markdown pipeline renders LaTeX math inline: `$E = mc^2$` and `$$\frac{a}{b}$$` render as Unicode-formatted math instead of the raw TeX source. Works for inline and block math; unsupported syntax falls back to showing the literal TeX wrapped in a code span so it remains copyable.
This is always-on — nothing to configure. Classic CLI keeps the raw TeX.
## Light-terminal detection[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/tui#light-terminal-detection "Direct link to Light-terminal detection")
The TUI auto-detects light terminals and swaps to the light theme accordingly. Detection works in three layers:
  1. `HERMES_TUI_THEME` env var — highest priority. Values: `light`, `dark`, or a raw 6-char background hex (e.g. `ffffff`, `1a1a2e`).
  2. `COLORFGBG` env var — the classic "what's my background color?" hint used by xterm-derived terminals.
  3. Terminal background probe via OSC 11 — works on modern terminals (Ghostty, Warp, iTerm2, WezTerm, Kitty) that don't set `COLORFGBG`.


If you want the light theme permanently regardless of terminal:

```
exportHERMES_TUI_THEME=light
```

## Busy indicator styles[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/tui#busy-indicator-styles "Direct link to Busy indicator styles")
The status-bar busy indicator is pluggable — the default rotates Hermes' kawaii face palette every 2.5 seconds during agent work. Pick a different style via config or the `/indicator` slash command:

```
display:tui_status_indicator: kaomoji   # kaomoji | emoji | unicode | ascii
```

Or in-session: `/indicator emoji` (etc.). Styles ship with matched glyph widths so the rest of the status bar doesn't jitter on rotation.
## Auto-resume[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/tui#auto-resume "Direct link to Auto-resume")
By default, `hermes --tui` starts a fresh session each launch. To re-attach to the most recent TUI session automatically (useful when your terminal or SSH connection drops unexpectedly), opt in:

```
exportHERMES_TUI_RESUME=1# most-recent TUI session# or:exportHERMES_TUI_RESUME=<session-id># specific session
```

Unset the variable or pass `--resume <id>` explicitly to override on a per-launch basis.
## Status line[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/tui#status-line "Direct link to Status line")
The TUI's status line tracks agent state in real time:  
| Status  | Meaning  |  
| --- | --- |  
| `starting agent…`  | Session ID is live; tools and skills still coming online. You can type — messages queue and send when ready.  |  
| `ready`  | Agent is idle, accepting input.  |  
|  `thinking…` / `running…`  | Agent is reasoning or running a tool.  |  
| `interrupted`  | Current turn was cancelled; press Enter to send again.  |  
|  `forging session…` / `resuming…`  | Initial connect or `--resume` handshake.  |  
The per-skin status-bar colors and thresholds are shared with the classic CLI — see [Skins](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/skins) for customization.
The status line also shows:
  * **Working directory with git branch** — `~/projects/hermes-agent (docs/two-week-gap-sweep)`. The branch suffix updates when you `git checkout` in a side terminal (mtime-cached) so the TUI reflects your actual active branch, not whatever it was at launch.
  * **Per-prompt elapsed time** — `⏱ 12s/3m 45s` while the turn is running (live), frozen to `⏲ 32s / 3m 45s` after the turn completes. First number is time since last user message; second is total session duration. Resets on every new prompt.


## Configuration[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/tui#configuration "Direct link to Configuration")
The TUI respects all standard Hermes config: `~/.hermes/config.yaml`, profiles, personalities, skins, quick commands, credential pools, memory providers, tool/skill enablement. No TUI-specific config file exists.
A handful of keys tune the TUI surface specifically:

```
display:skin: default              # any built-in or custom skinpersonality: helpfuldetails_mode: collapsed    # hidden | collapsed | expanded — global accordion defaultsections:# optional: per-section overrides (any subset)thinking: expanded       # always opentools: expanded          # always openactivity: collapsed      # opt back IN to the activity panel (hidden by default)mouse_tracking:true# disable if your terminal conflicts with mouse reporting
```

Runtime toggles:
  * `/details [hidden|collapsed|expanded|cycle]` — set the global mode
  * `/details <section> [hidden|collapsed|expanded|reset]` — override one section (sections: `thinking`, `tools`, `subagents`, `activity`)


**Default visibility**
The TUI ships with opinionated per-section defaults that stream the turn as a live transcript instead of a wall of chevrons:
  * `thinking` — **expanded**. Reasoning streams inline as the model emits it.
  * `tools` — **expanded**. Tool calls and their results render open.
  * `subagents` — falls through to the global `details_mode` (collapsed under chevron by default — stays quiet until a delegation actually happens).
  * `activity` — **hidden**. Ambient meta (gateway hints, terminal-parity nudges, background notifications) is noise for most day-to-day use. Tool failures still render inline on the failing tool row; ambient errors/warnings surface via a floating-alert backstop when every panel is hidden.


Per-section overrides take precedence over both the section default and the global `details_mode`. To reshape the layout:
  * `display.sections.thinking: collapsed` — put thinking back under a chevron
  * `display.sections.tools: collapsed` — put tool calls back under a chevron
  * `display.sections.activity: collapsed` — opt the activity panel back in
  * `/details <section> <mode>` at runtime


Anything set explicitly in `display.sections` wins over the defaults, so existing configs keep working unchanged.
## Sessions[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/tui#sessions "Direct link to Sessions")
Sessions are shared between the TUI and the classic CLI — both write to the same `~/.hermes/state.db`. You can start a session in one, resume in the other. The session picker surfaces sessions from both sources, with a source tag.
See [Sessions](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/sessions) for lifecycle, search, compression, and export.
## Reverting to the classic CLI[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/tui#reverting-to-the-classic-cli "Direct link to Reverting to the classic CLI")
Launching `hermes` (without `--tui`) stays on the classic CLI. To make a machine prefer the TUI, set `HERMES_TUI=1` in your shell profile. To go back, unset it.
If the TUI fails to launch (no Node, missing bundle, TTY issue), Hermes prints a diagnostic and falls back — rather than leaving you stuck.
