The following is the complete skill definition that Hermes loads when this skill is triggered. This is what the agent sees as instructions when the skill is active.
# Authoring Hermes-Agent Skills (in-repo)
## Overview[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/software-development/software-development-hermes-agent-skill-authoring#overview "Direct link to Overview")
There are two places a SKILL.md can live:
  1. **User-local:** `~/.hermes/skills/<maybe-category>/<name>/SKILL.md` — personal, not shared. Created via `skill_manage(action='create')`.
  2. **In-repo (this skill is about this case):** `/home/bb/hermes-agent/skills/<category>/<name>/SKILL.md` — committed, shipped with the package. Use `write_file` + `git add`. `skill_manage(action='create')` does NOT target this tree.


## When to Use[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/software-development/software-development-hermes-agent-skill-authoring#when-to-use "Direct link to When to Use")
  * User asks you to add a skill "in this branch / repo / commit"
  * You're committing a reusable workflow that should ship with hermes-agent
  * You're editing an existing skill under `/home/bb/hermes-agent/skills/` (use `patch` for small edits, `write_file` for rewrites; `skill_manage` still works for patch on in-repo skills, but not for `create`)


## Required Frontmatter[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/software-development/software-development-hermes-agent-skill-authoring#required-frontmatter "Direct link to Required Frontmatter")
Source of truth: `tools/skill_manager_tool.py::_validate_frontmatter`. Hard requirements:
  * Starts with `---` as the first bytes (no leading blank line).
  * Closes with `\n---\n` before the body.
  * Parses as a YAML mapping.
  * `name` field present.
  * `description` field present, ≤ **1024 chars** (`MAX_DESCRIPTION_LENGTH`).
  * Non-empty body after the closing `---`.


Peer-matched shape used by every skill under `skills/software-development/`:

```
---name: my-skill-name               # lowercase, hyphens, ≤64 chars (MAX_NAME_LENGTH)description: Use when <trigger>. <one-line behavior>.version: 1.0.0author: Hermes Agentlicense: MITmetadata:hermes:tags:[short, descriptive, tags]related_skills:[other-skill, another-skill]---
```

`version` / `author` / `license` / `metadata` are NOT enforced by the validator, but every peer has them — omit and your skill sticks out.
## Size Limits[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/software-development/software-development-hermes-agent-skill-authoring#size-limits "Direct link to Size Limits")
  * Description: ≤ 1024 chars (enforced).
  * Full SKILL.md: ≤ 100,000 chars (enforced as `MAX_SKILL_CONTENT_CHARS`, ~36k tokens).
  * Peer skills in `software-development/` sit at **8-14k chars**. Aim for that range. If you're pushing past 20k, split into `references/*.md` and reference them from SKILL.md.


## Peer-Matched Structure[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/software-development/software-development-hermes-agent-skill-authoring#peer-matched-structure "Direct link to Peer-Matched Structure")
Every in-repo skill follows roughly:

```
# <Title>## OverviewOne or two paragraphs: what and why.## When to Use- Bulleted triggers- "Don't use for:" counter-triggers## <Topic sections specific to the skill>- Quick-reference tables are common- Code blocks with exact commands- Hermes-specific recipes (tests via scripts/run_tests.sh, ui-tui paths, etc.)## Common PitfallsNumbered list of mistakes and their fixes.## Verification Checklist- [ ] Checkbox list of post-action verifications## One-Shot Recipes (optional)Named scenarios → concrete command sequences.
```

Not every section is mandatory, but `Overview` + `When to Use` + actionable body + pitfalls are the minimum for the skill to feel like a peer.
## Directory Placement[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/software-development/software-development-hermes-agent-skill-authoring#directory-placement "Direct link to Directory Placement")

```
skills/<category>/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
```

Categories currently in repo (confirm with `ls skills/`): `autonomous-ai-agents`, `creative`, `data-science`, `devops`, `dogfood`, `email`, `gaming`, `github`, `leisure`, `mcp`, `media`, `mlops/*`, `note-taking`, `productivity`, `red-teaming`, `research`, `smart-home`, `social-media`, `software-development`.
Pick the closest existing category. Don't invent new top-level categories casually.
## Workflow[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/software-development/software-development-hermes-agent-skill-authoring#workflow "Direct link to Workflow")
  1. **Survey peers** in the target category: 

```
ls skills/<category>/
```

Read 2-3 peer SKILL.md files to match tone and structure.
  2. **Check validator constraints** in `tools/skill_manager_tool.py` if unsure.
  3. **Draft** with `write_file` to `skills/<category>/<name>/SKILL.md`.
  4. **Validate locally** : 

```
import yaml, re, pathlibcontent = pathlib.Path("skills/<category>/<name>/SKILL.md").read_text()assert content.startswith("---")m = re.search(r'\n---\s*\n', content[3:])fm = yaml.safe_load(content[3:m.start()+3])assert"name"in fm and"description"in fmassertlen(fm["description"])<=1024assertlen(content)<=100_000
```

  5. **Git add + commit** on the active branch.
  6. **Note:** the CURRENT session's skill loader is cached — `skill_view` / `skills_list` will not see the new skill until a new session. This is expected, not a bug.


## Cross-Referencing Other Skills[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/software-development/software-development-hermes-agent-skill-authoring#cross-referencing-other-skills "Direct link to Cross-Referencing Other Skills")
`metadata.hermes.related_skills` unions both trees (`skills/` in-repo and `~/.hermes/skills/`) at load time. You CAN reference a user-local skill from an in-repo skill, but it won't resolve for other users who clone the repo fresh. Prefer referencing only in-repo skills from in-repo skills. If a frequently-referenced skill lives only in `~/.hermes/skills/`, consider promoting it to the repo.
## Editing Existing In-Repo Skills[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/software-development/software-development-hermes-agent-skill-authoring#editing-existing-in-repo-skills "Direct link to Editing Existing In-Repo Skills")
  * **Small fix (typo, added pitfall, tightened trigger):** `skill_manage(action='patch', name=..., old_string=..., new_string=...)` works fine on in-repo skills.
  * **Major rewrite:** `write_file` the whole SKILL.md. `skill_manage(action='edit')` also works but requires supplying the full new content.
  * **Adding supporting files:** `write_file` to `skills/<category>/<name>/references/<file>.md`, `templates/<file>`, or `scripts/<file>`. `skill_manage(action='write_file')` also works and enforces the references/templates/scripts/assets subdir allowlist.
  * **Always commit** the edit — in-repo skills are source, not runtime state.


## Common Pitfalls[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/software-development/software-development-hermes-agent-skill-authoring#common-pitfalls "Direct link to Common Pitfalls")
  1. **Using`skill_manage(action='create')` for an in-repo skill.** It writes to `~/.hermes/skills/`, not the repo tree. Use `write_file` for in-repo creation.
  2. **Leading whitespace before`---`.** The validator checks `content.startswith("---")`; any leading blank line or BOM fails validation.
  3. **Description too generic.** Peer descriptions start with "Use when ..." and describe the _trigger class_ , not the one task. "Use when debugging X" > "Debug X".
  4. **Forgetting the author/license/metadata block.** Not validator-enforced, but every peer has it; omitting makes the skill look half-finished.
  5. **Writing a skill that duplicates a peer.** Before creating, `ls skills/<category>/` and open 2-3 peers. Prefer extending an existing skill to creating a narrow sibling.
  6. **Expecting the current session to see the new skill.** It won't. The skill loader is initialized at session start. Verify in a fresh session or via `skill_view` using the exact path.
  7. **Linking to skills that don't exist in-repo.** `related_skills: [some-user-local-skill]` works for you but breaks for other clones. Prefer only in-repo links.


## Verification Checklist[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/software-development/software-development-hermes-agent-skill-authoring#verification-checklist "Direct link to Verification Checklist")
