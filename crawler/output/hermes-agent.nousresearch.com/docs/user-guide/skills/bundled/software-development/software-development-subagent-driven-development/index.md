The following is the complete skill definition that Hermes loads when this skill is triggered. This is what the agent sees as instructions when the skill is active.
# Subagent-Driven Development
## Overview[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/software-development/software-development-subagent-driven-development#overview "Direct link to Overview")
Execute implementation plans by dispatching fresh subagents per task with systematic two-stage review.
**Core principle:** Fresh subagent per task + two-stage review (spec then quality) = high quality, fast iteration.
## When to Use[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/software-development/software-development-subagent-driven-development#when-to-use "Direct link to When to Use")
Use this skill when:
  * You have an implementation plan (from writing-plans skill or user requirements)
  * Tasks are mostly independent
  * Quality and spec compliance are important
  * You want automated review between tasks


**vs. manual execution:**
  * Fresh context per task (no confusion from accumulated state)
  * Automated review process catches issues early
  * Consistent quality checks across all tasks
  * Subagents can ask questions before starting work


## The Process[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/software-development/software-development-subagent-driven-development#the-process "Direct link to The Process")
### 1. Read and Parse Plan[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/software-development/software-development-subagent-driven-development#1-read-and-parse-plan "Direct link to 1. Read and Parse Plan")
Read the plan file. Extract ALL tasks with their full text and context upfront. Create a todo list:

```
# Read the planread_file("docs/plans/feature-plan.md")# Create todo list with all taskstodo([{"id":"task-1","content":"Create User model with email field","status":"pending"},{"id":"task-2","content":"Add password hashing utility","status":"pending"},{"id":"task-3","content":"Create login endpoint","status":"pending"},
```

**Key:** Read the plan ONCE. Extract everything. Don't make subagents read the plan file — provide the full task text directly in context.
### 2. Per-Task Workflow[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/software-development/software-development-subagent-driven-development#2-per-task-workflow "Direct link to 2. Per-Task Workflow")
For EACH task in the plan:
#### Step 1: Dispatch Implementer Subagent[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/software-development/software-development-subagent-driven-development#step-1-dispatch-implementer-subagent "Direct link to Step 1: Dispatch Implementer Subagent")
Use `delegate_task` with complete context:

```
delegate_task(    goal="Implement Task 1: Create User model with email and password_hash fields",    context="""    TASK FROM PLAN:    - Create: src/models/user.py    - Add User class with email (str) and password_hash (str) fields    - Use bcrypt for password hashing    - Include __repr__ for debugging    FOLLOW TDD:    1. Write failing test in tests/models/test_user.py    2. Run: pytest tests/models/test_user.py -v (verify FAIL)    3. Write minimal implementation    4. Run: pytest tests/models/test_user.py -v (verify PASS)    5. Run: pytest tests/ -q (verify no regressions)    6. Commit: git add -A && git commit -m "feat: add User model with password hashing"    PROJECT CONTEXT:    - Python 3.11, Flask app in src/app.py    - Existing models in src/models/    - Tests use pytest, run from project root    - bcrypt already in requirements.txt    """,    toolsets=['terminal','file']
```

#### Step 2: Dispatch Spec Compliance Reviewer[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/software-development/software-development-subagent-driven-development#step-2-dispatch-spec-compliance-reviewer "Direct link to Step 2: Dispatch Spec Compliance Reviewer")
After the implementer completes, verify against the original spec:

```
delegate_task(    goal="Review if implementation matches the spec from the plan",    context="""    ORIGINAL TASK SPEC:    - Create src/models/user.py with User class    - Fields: email (str), password_hash (str)    - Use bcrypt for password hashing    - Include __repr__    CHECK:    - [ ] All requirements from spec implemented?    - [ ] File paths match spec?    - [ ] Function signatures match spec?    - [ ] Behavior matches expected?    - [ ] Nothing extra added (no scope creep)?    OUTPUT: PASS or list of specific spec gaps to fix.    """,    toolsets=['file']
```

**If spec issues found:** Fix gaps, then re-run spec review. Continue only when spec-compliant.
#### Step 3: Dispatch Code Quality Reviewer[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/software-development/software-development-subagent-driven-development#step-3-dispatch-code-quality-reviewer "Direct link to Step 3: Dispatch Code Quality Reviewer")
After spec compliance passes:

```
delegate_task(    goal="Review code quality for Task 1 implementation",    context="""    FILES TO REVIEW:    - src/models/user.py    - tests/models/test_user.py    CHECK:    - [ ] Follows project conventions and style?    - [ ] Proper error handling?    - [ ] Clear variable/function names?    - [ ] Adequate test coverage?    - [ ] No obvious bugs or missed edge cases?    - [ ] No security issues?    OUTPUT FORMAT:    - Critical Issues: [must fix before proceeding]    - Important Issues: [should fix]    - Minor Issues: [optional]    - Verdict: APPROVED or REQUEST_CHANGES    """,    toolsets=['file']
```

**If quality issues found:** Fix issues, re-review. Continue only when approved.
#### Step 4: Mark Complete[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/software-development/software-development-subagent-driven-development#step-4-mark-complete "Direct link to Step 4: Mark Complete")

```
todo([{"id":"task-1","content":"Create User model with email field","status":"completed"}], merge=True)
```

### 3. Final Review[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/software-development/software-development-subagent-driven-development#3-final-review "Direct link to 3. Final Review")
After ALL tasks are complete, dispatch a final integration reviewer:

```
delegate_task(    goal="Review the entire implementation for consistency and integration issues",    context="""    All tasks from the plan are complete. Review the full implementation:    - Do all components work together?    - Any inconsistencies between tasks?    - All tests passing?    - Ready for merge?    """,    toolsets=['terminal','file']
```

### 4. Verify and Commit[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/software-development/software-development-subagent-driven-development#4-verify-and-commit "Direct link to 4. Verify and Commit")

```
# Run full test suitepytest tests/ -q# Review all changesgitdiff--stat# Final commit if neededgitadd-A&&git commit -m"feat: complete [feature name] implementation"
```

## Task Granularity[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/software-development/software-development-subagent-driven-development#task-granularity "Direct link to Task Granularity")
**Each task = 2-5 minutes of focused work.**
**Too big:**
  * "Implement user authentication system"


**Right size:**
  * "Create User model with email and password fields"
  * "Add password hashing function"
  * "Create login endpoint"
  * "Add JWT token generation"
  * "Create registration endpoint"


## Red Flags — Never Do These[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/software-development/software-development-subagent-driven-development#red-flags--never-do-these "Direct link to Red Flags — Never Do These")
  * Start implementation without a plan
  * Skip reviews (spec compliance OR code quality)
  * Proceed with unfixed critical/important issues
  * Dispatch multiple implementation subagents for tasks that touch the same files
  * Make subagent read the plan file (provide full text in context instead)
  * Skip scene-setting context (subagent needs to understand where the task fits)
  * Ignore subagent questions (answer before letting them proceed)
  * Accept "close enough" on spec compliance
  * Skip review loops (reviewer found issues → implementer fixes → review again)
  * Let implementer self-review replace actual review (both are needed)
  * **Start code quality review before spec compliance is PASS** (wrong order)
  * Move to next task while either review has open issues


## Handling Issues[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/software-development/software-development-subagent-driven-development#handling-issues "Direct link to Handling Issues")
### If Subagent Asks Questions[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/software-development/software-development-subagent-driven-development#if-subagent-asks-questions "Direct link to If Subagent Asks Questions")
  * Answer clearly and completely
  * Provide additional context if needed
  * Don't rush them into implementation


### If Reviewer Finds Issues[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/software-development/software-development-subagent-driven-development#if-reviewer-finds-issues "Direct link to If Reviewer Finds Issues")
  * Implementer subagent (or a new one) fixes them
  * Reviewer reviews again
  * Repeat until approved
  * Don't skip the re-review


### If Subagent Fails a Task[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/software-development/software-development-subagent-driven-development#if-subagent-fails-a-task "Direct link to If Subagent Fails a Task")
  * Dispatch a new fix subagent with specific instructions about what went wrong
  * Don't try to fix manually in the controller session (context pollution)


## Efficiency Notes[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/software-development/software-development-subagent-driven-development#efficiency-notes "Direct link to Efficiency Notes")
**Why fresh subagent per task:**
  * Prevents context pollution from accumulated state
  * Each subagent gets clean, focused context
  * No confusion from prior tasks' code or reasoning


**Why two-stage review:**
  * Spec review catches under/over-building early
  * Quality review ensures the implementation is well-built
  * Catches issues before they compound across tasks


**Cost trade-off:**
  * More subagent invocations (implementer + 2 reviewers per task)
  * But catches issues early (cheaper than debugging compounded problems later)


## Integration with Other Skills[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/software-development/software-development-subagent-driven-development#integration-with-other-skills "Direct link to Integration with Other Skills")
### With writing-plans[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/software-development/software-development-subagent-driven-development#with-writing-plans "Direct link to With writing-plans")
This skill EXECUTES plans created by the writing-plans skill:
  1. User requirements → writing-plans → implementation plan
  2. Implementation plan → subagent-driven-development → working code


### With test-driven-development[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/software-development/software-development-subagent-driven-development#with-test-driven-development "Direct link to With test-driven-development")
Implementer subagents should follow TDD:
  1. Write failing test first
  2. Implement minimal code
  3. Verify test passes
  4. Commit


Include TDD instructions in every implementer context.
### With requesting-code-review[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/software-development/software-development-subagent-driven-development#with-requesting-code-review "Direct link to With requesting-code-review")
The two-stage review process IS the code review. For final integration review, use the requesting-code-review skill's review dimensions.
### With systematic-debugging[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/software-development/software-development-subagent-driven-development#with-systematic-debugging "Direct link to With systematic-debugging")
If a subagent encounters bugs during implementation:
  1. Follow systematic-debugging process
  2. Find root cause before fixing
  3. Write regression test
  4. Resume implementation


## Example Workflow[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/software-development/software-development-subagent-driven-development#example-workflow "Direct link to Example Workflow")

When the orchestration involves significant context usage, long review loops, or complex validation checkpoints, load these references for the specific discipline:
  * **`references/context-budget-discipline.md`**— Four-tier context degradation model (PEAK / GOOD / DEGRADING / POOR), read-depth rules that scale with context window size, and early warning signs of silent degradation. Load when a run will clearly consume significant context (multi-phase plans, many subagents, large artifacts).
  * **`references/gates-taxonomy.md`**— The four canonical gate types (Pre-flight, Revision, Escalation, Abort) with behavior, recovery, and examples. Load when designing or reviewing any workflow that has validation checkpoints — use the vocabulary explicitly so each gate has defined entry, failure behavior, and resumption rules.
