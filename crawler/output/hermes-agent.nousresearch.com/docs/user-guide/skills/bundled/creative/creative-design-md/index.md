The following is the complete skill definition that Hermes loads when this skill is triggered. This is what the agent sees as instructions when the skill is active.
# DESIGN.md Skill
DESIGN.md is Google's open spec (Apache-2.0, `google-labs-code/design.md`) for describing a visual identity to coding agents. One file combines:
  * **YAML front matter** — machine-readable design tokens (normative values)
  * **Markdown body** — human-readable rationale, organized into canonical sections


Tokens give exact values. Prose tells agents _why_ those values exist and how to apply them. The CLI (`npx @google/design.md`) lints structure + WCAG contrast, diffs versions for regressions, and exports to Tailwind or W3C DTCG JSON.
## When to use this skill[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/creative/creative-design-md#when-to-use-this-skill "Direct link to When to use this skill")
  * User asks for a DESIGN.md file, design tokens, or a design system spec
  * User wants consistent UI/brand across multiple projects or tools
  * User pastes an existing DESIGN.md and asks to lint, diff, export, or extend it
  * User asks to port a style guide into a format agents can consume
  * User wants contrast / WCAG accessibility validation on their color palette


For purely visual inspiration or layout examples, use `popular-web-designs` instead. For _process and taste_ when designing a one-off HTML artifact from scratch (prototype, deck, landing page, component lab), use `claude-design`. This skill is for the _formal spec file_ itself.

```

## Token types[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/creative/creative-design-md#token-types "Direct link to Token types")  
| Type  | Format  | Example  |  
| --- | --- | --- |  
| Color  |  `#` + hex (sRGB)  | `"#1A1C1E"`  |  
| Dimension  | number + unit (`px`, `em`, `rem`)  |  `48px`, `-0.02em`  |  
| Token reference  | `{path.to.token}`  | `{colors.primary}`  |  
| Typography  | object with `fontFamily`, `fontSize`, `fontWeight`, `lineHeight`, `letterSpacing`, `fontFeature`, `fontVariation`  | see above  |  
Component property whitelist: `backgroundColor`, `textColor`, `typography`, `rounded`, `padding`, `size`, `height`, `width`. Variants (hover, active, pressed) are **separate component entries** with related key names (`button-primary-hover`), not nested.
## Canonical section order[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/creative/creative-design-md#canonical-section-order "Direct link to Canonical section order")
Sections are optional, but present ones MUST appear in this order. Duplicate headings reject the file.
  1. Overview (alias: Brand & Style)
  2. Colors
  3. Typography
  4. Layout (alias: Layout & Spacing)
  5. Elevation & Depth (alias: Elevation)
  6. Shapes
  7. Components
  8. Do's and Don'ts


Unknown sections are preserved, not errored. Unknown token names are accepted if the value type is valid. Unknown component properties produce a warning.
## Workflow: authoring a new DESIGN.md[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/creative/creative-design-md#workflow-authoring-a-new-designmd "Direct link to Workflow: authoring a new DESIGN.md")
  1. **Ask the user** (or infer) the brand tone, accent color, and typography direction. If they provided a site, image, or vibe, translate it to the token shape above.
  2. **Write`DESIGN.md`** in their project root using `write_file`. Always include `name:` and `colors:`; other sections optional but encouraged.
  3. **Use token references** (`{colors.primary}`) in the `components:` section instead of re-typing hex values. Keeps the palette single-source.
  4. **Lint it** (see below). Fix any broken references or WCAG failures before returning.
  5. **If the user has an existing project** , also write Tailwind or DTCG exports next to the file (`tailwind.theme.json`, `tokens.json`).


## Workflow: lint / diff / export[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/creative/creative-design-md#workflow-lint--diff--export "Direct link to Workflow: lint / diff / export")
The CLI is `@google/design.md` (Node). Use `npx` — no global install needed.

```
# Validate structure + token references + WCAG contrastnpx -y @google/design.md lint DESIGN.md# Compare two versions, fail on regression (exit 1 = regression)npx -y @google/design.md diff DESIGN.md DESIGN-v2.md# Export to Tailwind theme JSONnpx -y @google/design.md export--format tailwind DESIGN.md > tailwind.theme.json# Export to W3C DTCG (Design Tokens Format Module) JSONnpx -y @google/design.md export--format dtcg DESIGN.md > tokens.json# Print the spec itself — useful when injecting into an agent promptnpx -y @google/design.md spec --rules-only --format json
```

All commands accept `-` for stdin. `lint` returns exit 1 on errors. Use the `--format json` flag and parse the output if you need to report findings structurally.
### Lint rule reference (what the 7 rules catch)[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/creative/creative-design-md#lint-rule-reference-what-the-7-rules-catch "Direct link to Lint rule reference \(what the 7 rules catch\)")
  * `broken-ref` (error) — `{colors.missing}` points at a non-existent token
  * `duplicate-section` (error) — same `## Heading` appears twice
  * `invalid-color`, `invalid-dimension`, `invalid-typography` (error)
  * `wcag-contrast` (warning/info) — component `textColor` vs `backgroundColor` ratio against WCAG AA (4.5:1) and AAA (7:1)
  * `unknown-component-property` (warning) — outside the whitelist above


When the user cares about accessibility, call this out explicitly in your summary — WCAG findings are the most load-bearing reason to use the CLI.
## Pitfalls[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/creative/creative-design-md#pitfalls "Direct link to Pitfalls")
  * **Don't nest component variants.** `button-primary.hover` is wrong; `button-primary-hover` as a sibling key is right.
  * **Hex colors must be quoted strings.** YAML will otherwise choke on `#` or truncate values like `#1A1C1E` oddly.
  * **Negative dimensions need quotes too.** `letterSpacing: -0.02em` parses as a YAML flow — write `letterSpacing: "-0.02em"`.
  * **Section order is enforced.** If the user gives you prose in a random order, reorder it to match the canonical list before saving.
  * **`version: alpha`is the current spec version** (as of Apr 2026). The spec is marked alpha — watch for breaking changes.
  * **Token references resolve by dotted path.** `{colors.primary}` works; `{primary}` does not.
