The following is the complete skill definition that Hermes loads when this skill is triggered. This is what the agent sees as instructions when the skill is active.
# Native MCP Client
Hermes Agent has a built-in MCP client that connects to MCP servers at startup, discovers their tools, and makes them available as first-class tools the agent can call directly. No bridge CLI needed -- tools from MCP servers appear alongside built-in tools like `terminal`, `read_file`, etc.
## When to Use[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/mcp/mcp-native-mcp#when-to-use "Direct link to When to Use")
Use this whenever you want to:
  * Connect to MCP servers and use their tools from within Hermes Agent
  * Add external capabilities (filesystem access, GitHub, databases, APIs) via MCP
  * Run local stdio-based MCP servers (npx, uvx, or any command)
  * Connect to remote HTTP/StreamableHTTP MCP servers
  * Have MCP tools auto-discovered and available in every conversation


For ad-hoc, one-off MCP tool calls from the terminal without configuring anything, see the `mcporter` skill instead.
## Prerequisites[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/mcp/mcp-native-mcp#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")
  * **mcp Python package** -- optional dependency; install with `pip install mcp`. If not installed, MCP support is silently disabled.
  * **Node.js** -- required for `npx`-based MCP servers (most community servers)
  * **uv** -- required for `uvx`-based MCP servers (Python-based servers)


Install the MCP SDK:

```
pip install mcp# or, if using uv:uv pip install mcp
```

## Quick Start[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/mcp/mcp-native-mcp#quick-start "Direct link to Quick Start")
Add MCP servers to `~/.hermes/config.yaml` under the `mcp_servers` key:

```
mcp_servers:time:command:"uvx"args:["mcp-server-time"]
```

Restart Hermes Agent. On startup it will:
  1. Connect to the server
  2. Discover available tools
  3. Register them with the prefix `mcp_time_*`
  4. Inject them into all platform toolsets


You can then use the tools naturally -- just ask the agent to get the current time.
## Configuration Reference[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/mcp/mcp-native-mcp#configuration-reference "Direct link to Configuration Reference")
Each entry under `mcp_servers` is a server name mapped to its config. There are two transport types: **stdio** (command-based) and **HTTP** (url-based).
### Stdio Transport (command + args)[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/mcp/mcp-native-mcp#stdio-transport-command--args "Direct link to Stdio Transport \(command + args\)")

```
mcp_servers:server_name:command:"npx"# (required) executable to runargs:["-y","pkg-name"]# (optional) command arguments, default: []env:# (optional) environment variables for the subprocessSOME_API_KEY:"value"timeout:120# (optional) per-tool-call timeout in seconds, default: 120connect_timeout:60# (optional) initial connection timeout in seconds, default: 60
```

### HTTP Transport (url)[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/mcp/mcp-native-mcp#http-transport-url "Direct link to HTTP Transport \(url\)")

```
mcp_servers:server_name:url:"https://my-server.example.com/mcp"# (required) server URLheaders:# (optional) HTTP headersAuthorization:"Bearer sk-..."timeout:180# (optional) per-tool-call timeout in seconds, default: 120connect_timeout:60# (optional) initial connection timeout in seconds, default: 60
```

### All Config Options[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/mcp/mcp-native-mcp#all-config-options "Direct link to All Config Options")  
| Option  | Type  | Default  | Description  |  
| --- | --- | --- | --- |  
| `command`  | string  | --  | Executable to run (stdio transport, required)  |  
| `args`  | list  | `[]`  | Arguments passed to the command  |  
| `env`  | dict  | `{}`  | Extra environment variables for the subprocess  |  
| `url`  | string  | --  | Server URL (HTTP transport, required)  |  
| `headers`  | dict  | `{}`  | HTTP headers sent with every request  |  
| `timeout`  | int  | `120`  | Per-tool-call timeout in seconds  |  
| `connect_timeout`  | int  | `60`  | Timeout for initial connection and discovery  |  
Note: A server config must have either `command` (stdio) or `url` (HTTP), not both.
## How It Works[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/mcp/mcp-native-mcp#how-it-works "Direct link to How It Works")
### Startup Discovery[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/mcp/mcp-native-mcp#startup-discovery "Direct link to Startup Discovery")
When Hermes Agent starts, `discover_mcp_tools()` is called during tool initialization:
  1. Reads `mcp_servers` from `~/.hermes/config.yaml`
  2. For each server, spawns a connection in a dedicated background event loop
  3. Initializes the MCP session and calls `list_tools()` to discover available tools
  4. Registers each tool in the Hermes tool registry


### Tool Naming Convention[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/mcp/mcp-native-mcp#tool-naming-convention "Direct link to Tool Naming Convention")
MCP tools are registered with the naming pattern:

```
mcp_{server_name}_{tool_name}
```

Hyphens and dots in names are replaced with underscores for LLM API compatibility.
Examples:
  * Server `filesystem`, tool `read_file` → `mcp_filesystem_read_file`
  * Server `github`, tool `list-issues` → `mcp_github_list_issues`
  * Server `my-api`, tool `fetch.data` → `mcp_my_api_fetch_data`


### Auto-Injection[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/mcp/mcp-native-mcp#auto-injection "Direct link to Auto-Injection")
After discovery, MCP tools are automatically injected into all `hermes-*` platform toolsets (CLI, Discord, Telegram, etc.). This means MCP tools are available in every conversation without any additional configuration.
### Connection Lifecycle[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/mcp/mcp-native-mcp#connection-lifecycle "Direct link to Connection Lifecycle")
  * Each server runs as a long-lived asyncio Task in a background daemon thread
  * Connections persist for the lifetime of the agent process
  * If a connection drops, automatic reconnection with exponential backoff kicks in (up to 5 retries, max 60s backoff)
  * On agent shutdown, all connections are gracefully closed


### Idempotency[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/mcp/mcp-native-mcp#idempotency "Direct link to Idempotency")
`discover_mcp_tools()` is idempotent -- calling it multiple times only connects to servers that aren't already connected. Failed servers are retried on subsequent calls.
## Transport Types[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/mcp/mcp-native-mcp#transport-types "Direct link to Transport Types")
### Stdio Transport[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/mcp/mcp-native-mcp#stdio-transport "Direct link to Stdio Transport")
The most common transport. Hermes launches the MCP server as a subprocess and communicates over stdin/stdout.

```
mcp_servers:filesystem:command:"npx"args:["-y","@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem","/home/user/projects"]
```

The subprocess inherits a **filtered** environment (see Security section below) plus any variables you specify in `env`.
### HTTP / StreamableHTTP Transport[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/mcp/mcp-native-mcp#http--streamablehttp-transport "Direct link to HTTP / StreamableHTTP Transport")
For remote or shared MCP servers. Requires the `mcp` package to include HTTP client support (`mcp.client.streamable_http`).

```
mcp_servers:remote_api:url:"https://mcp.example.com/mcp"headers:Authorization:"Bearer sk-..."
```

If HTTP support is not available in your installed `mcp` version, the server will fail with an ImportError and other servers will continue normally.
## Security[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/mcp/mcp-native-mcp#security "Direct link to Security")
### Environment Variable Filtering[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/mcp/mcp-native-mcp#environment-variable-filtering "Direct link to Environment Variable Filtering")
For stdio servers, Hermes does NOT pass your full shell environment to MCP subprocesses. Only safe baseline variables are inherited:
  * `PATH`, `HOME`, `USER`, `LANG`, `LC_ALL`, `TERM`, `SHELL`, `TMPDIR`
  * Any `XDG_*` variables


All other environment variables (API keys, tokens, secrets) are excluded unless you explicitly add them via the `env` config key. This prevents accidental credential leakage to untrusted MCP servers.

```
mcp_servers:github:command:"npx"args:["-y","@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"]env:# Only this token is passed to the subprocessGITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN:"ghp_..."
```

### Credential Stripping in Error Messages[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/mcp/mcp-native-mcp#credential-stripping-in-error-messages "Direct link to Credential Stripping in Error Messages")
If an MCP tool call fails, any credential-like patterns in the error message are automatically redacted before being shown to the LLM. This covers:
  * GitHub PATs (`ghp_...`)
  * OpenAI-style keys (`sk-...`)
  * Bearer tokens
  * Generic `token=`, `key=`, `API_KEY=`, `password=`, `secret=` patterns


## Troubleshooting[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/mcp/mcp-native-mcp#troubleshooting "Direct link to Troubleshooting")
### "MCP SDK not available -- skipping MCP tool discovery"[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/mcp/mcp-native-mcp#mcp-sdk-not-available----skipping-mcp-tool-discovery "Direct link to "MCP SDK not available -- skipping MCP tool discovery"")
The `mcp` Python package is not installed. Install it:

```
pip install mcp
```

### "No MCP servers configured"[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/mcp/mcp-native-mcp#no-mcp-servers-configured "Direct link to "No MCP servers configured"")
No `mcp_servers` key in `~/.hermes/config.yaml`, or it's empty. Add at least one server.
### "Failed to connect to MCP server 'X'"[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/mcp/mcp-native-mcp#failed-to-connect-to-mcp-server-x "Direct link to "Failed to connect to MCP server 'X'"")
Common causes:
  * **Command not found** : The `command` binary isn't on PATH. Ensure `npx`, `uvx`, or the relevant command is installed.
  * **Package not found** : For npx servers, the npm package may not exist or may need `-y` in args to auto-install.
  * **Timeout** : The server took too long to start. Increase `connect_timeout`.
  * **Port conflict** : For HTTP servers, the URL may be unreachable.


### "MCP server 'X' requires HTTP transport but mcp.client.streamable_http is not available"[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/mcp/mcp-native-mcp#mcp-server-x-requires-http-transport-but-mcpclientstreamable_http-is-not-available "Direct link to "MCP server 'X' requires HTTP transport but mcp.client.streamable_http is not available"")
Your `mcp` package version doesn't include HTTP client support. Upgrade:

```
pip install--upgrade mcp
```

### Tools not appearing[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/mcp/mcp-native-mcp#tools-not-appearing "Direct link to Tools not appearing")
  * Check that the server is listed under `mcp_servers` (not `mcp` or `servers`)
  * Ensure the YAML indentation is correct
  * Look at Hermes Agent startup logs for connection messages
  * Tool names are prefixed with `mcp_{server}_{tool}` -- look for that pattern


### Connection keeps dropping[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/mcp/mcp-native-mcp#connection-keeps-dropping "Direct link to Connection keeps dropping")
The client retries up to 5 times with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, capped at 60s). If the server is fundamentally unreachable, it gives up after 5 attempts. Check the server process and network connectivity.
## Examples[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/mcp/mcp-native-mcp#examples "Direct link to Examples")
### Time Server (uvx)[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/mcp/mcp-native-mcp#time-server-uvx "Direct link to Time Server \(uvx\)")

```
mcp_servers:time:command:"uvx"args:["mcp-server-time"]
```

Registers tools like `mcp_time_get_current_time`.
### Filesystem Server (npx)[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/mcp/mcp-native-mcp#filesystem-server-npx "Direct link to Filesystem Server \(npx\)")

```
mcp_servers:filesystem:command:"npx"args:["-y","@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem","/home/user/documents"]timeout:30
```

Registers tools like `mcp_filesystem_read_file`, `mcp_filesystem_write_file`, `mcp_filesystem_list_directory`.
### GitHub Server with Authentication[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/mcp/mcp-native-mcp#github-server-with-authentication "Direct link to GitHub Server with Authentication")

```
mcp_servers:github:command:"npx"args:["-y","@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"]env:GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN:"ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"timeout:60
```

Registers tools like `mcp_github_list_issues`, `mcp_github_create_pull_request`, etc.
### Remote HTTP Server[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/mcp/mcp-native-mcp#remote-http-server "Direct link to Remote HTTP Server")

```
mcp_servers:company_api:url:"https://mcp.mycompany.com/v1/mcp"headers:Authorization:"Bearer sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"X-Team-Id:"engineering"timeout:180connect_timeout:30
```

### Multiple Servers[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/mcp/mcp-native-mcp#multiple-servers "Direct link to Multiple Servers")

```
mcp_servers:time:command:"uvx"args:["mcp-server-time"]filesystem:command:"npx"args:["-y","@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem","/tmp"]github:command:"npx"args:["-y","@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"]env:GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN:"ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"company_api:url:"https://mcp.internal.company.com/mcp"headers:Authorization:"Bearer sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"timeout:300
```

All tools from all servers are registered and available simultaneously. Each server's tools are prefixed with its name to avoid collisions.
## Sampling (Server-Initiated LLM Requests)[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/mcp/mcp-native-mcp#sampling-server-initiated-llm-requests "Direct link to Sampling \(Server-Initiated LLM Requests\)")
Hermes supports MCP's `sampling/createMessage` capability — MCP servers can request LLM completions through the agent during tool execution. This enables agent-in-the-loop workflows (data analysis, content generation, decision-making).
Sampling is **enabled by default**. Configure per server:

```
mcp_servers:my_server:command:"npx"args:["-y","my-mcp-server"]sampling:enabled:true# default: truemodel:"gemini-3-flash"# model override (optional)max_tokens_cap:4096# max tokens per requesttimeout:30# LLM call timeout (seconds)max_rpm:10# max requests per minuteallowed_models:[]# model whitelist (empty = all)max_tool_rounds:5# tool loop limit (0 = disable)log_level:"info"# audit verbosity
```

Servers can also include `tools` in sampling requests for multi-turn tool-augmented workflows. The `max_tool_rounds` config prevents infinite tool loops. Per-server audit metrics (requests, errors, tokens, tool use count) are tracked via `get_mcp_status()`.
Disable sampling for untrusted servers with `sampling: { enabled: false }`.
## Notes[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/bundled/mcp/mcp-native-mcp#notes "Direct link to Notes")
  * MCP tools are called synchronously from the agent's perspective but run asynchronously on a dedicated background event loop
  * Tool results are returned as JSON with either `{"result": "..."}` or `{"error": "..."}`
  * The native MCP client is independent of `mcporter` -- you can use both simultaneously
  * Server connections are persistent and shared across all conversations in the same agent process
  * Adding or removing servers requires restarting the agent (no hot-reload currently)
