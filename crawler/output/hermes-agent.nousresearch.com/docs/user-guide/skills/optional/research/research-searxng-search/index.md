The following is the complete skill definition that Hermes loads when this skill is triggered. This is what the agent sees as instructions when the skill is active.
# SearXNG Search
Free meta-search using [SearXNG](https://searxng.org/) — a privacy-respecting, self-hosted search aggregator that queries 70+ search engines simultaneously.
**No API key required** when using a public instance. Can also be self-hosted for full control. Automatically appears as a fallback when the main web search toolset (`FIRECRAWL_API_KEY`) is not configured.
## Configuration[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/optional/research/research-searxng-search#configuration "Direct link to Configuration")
SearXNG requires a `SEARXNG_URL` environment variable pointing to your SearXNG instance:

```
# Public instances (no setup required)SEARXNG_URL=https://searxng.example.com# Self-hosted SearXNGSEARXNG_URL=http://localhost:8888
```

If no instance is configured, this skill is unavailable and the agent falls back to other search options.
## Detection Flow[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/optional/research/research-searxng-search#detection-flow "Direct link to Detection Flow")
Check what is actually available before choosing an approach:

```
# Check if SEARXNG_URL is set and the instance is reachablecurl-s --max-time 5"${SEARXNG_URL}/search?q=test&format=json"|head-c200
```

Decision tree:
  1. If `SEARXNG_URL` is set and the instance responds, use SearXNG
  2. If `SEARXNG_URL` is unset or unreachable, fall back to other available search tools
  3. If the user wants SearXNG specifically, help them set up an instance or find a public one


## Method 1: CLI via curl (Preferred)[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/optional/research/research-searxng-search#method-1-cli-via-curl-preferred "Direct link to Method 1: CLI via curl \(Preferred\)")
Use `curl` via `terminal` to call the SearXNG JSON API. This avoids assuming any particular Python package is installed.

```
# Text search (JSON output)curl-s --max-time 10\"${SEARXNG_URL}/search?q=python+async+programming&format=json&engines=google,bing&limit=10"# With Safesearch offcurl-s --max-time 10\"${SEARXNG_URL}/search?q=example&format=json&safesearch=0"# Specific categories (general, news, science, etc.)curl-s --max-time 10\"${SEARXNG_URL}/search?q=AI+news&format=json&categories=news"
```

### Common CLI Flags[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/optional/research/research-searxng-search#common-cli-flags "Direct link to Common CLI Flags")  
| Flag  | Description  | Example  |  
| --- | --- | --- |  
| Query string (URL-encoded)  | `q=python+async`  |  
| `format`  | Output format: `json`, `csv`, `rss`  | `format=json`  |  
| `engines`  | Comma-separated engine names  | `engines=google,bing,ddg`  |  
| `limit`  | Max results per engine (default 10)  | `limit=5`  |  
| `categories`  | Filter by category  | `categories=news,science`  |  
| `safesearch`  | 0=none, 1=moderate, 2=strict  | `safesearch=0`  |  
| `time_range`  | Filter: `day`, `week`, `month`, `year`  | `time_range=week`  |  
### Parsing JSON Results[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/optional/research/research-searxng-search#parsing-json-results "Direct link to Parsing JSON Results")

```
# Extract titles and URLs from JSONcurl-s --max-time 10"${SEARXNG_URL}/search?q=fastapi&format=json&limit=5"\| python3 -c"import json, sysdata = json.load(sys.stdin)for r in data.get('results', []):    print(r.get('title',''))    print(r.get('url',''))    print(r.get('content','')[:200])    print()
```

Returns per result: `title`, `url`, `content` (snippet), `engine`, `parsed_url`, `img_src`, `thumbnail`, `author`, `published_date`
## Method 2: Python API via `requests`[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/optional/research/research-searxng-search#method-2-python-api-via-requests "Direct link to method-2-python-api-via-requests")
Use the SearXNG REST API directly from Python with the `requests` library:

```
import os, requests, urllib.parsebase_url = os.environ.get("SEARXNG_URL","")ifnot base_url:raise RuntimeError("SEARXNG_URL is not set")query ="fastapi deployment guide"params ={"q": query,"format":"json","limit":5,"engines":"google,bing",resp = requests.get(f"{base_url}/search", params=params, timeout=10)resp.raise_for_status()data = resp.json()for r in data.get("results",[]):print(r["title"])print(r["url"])print(r.get("content","")[:200])print()
```

## Method 3: searxng-data Python Package[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/optional/research/research-searxng-search#method-3-searxng-data-python-package "Direct link to Method 3: searxng-data Python Package")
For more structured access, install the `searxng-data` package:

```
pip install searxng-data
```


```
from searxng_data import engines# List available enginesprint(engines.list_engines())
```

Note: This package only provides engine metadata, not the search API itself.
## Self-Hosting SearXNG[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/optional/research/research-searxng-search#self-hosting-searxng "Direct link to Self-Hosting SearXNG")
To run your own SearXNG instance:

```
# Using Dockerdocker run -d-p8888:8080 \-v$(pwd)/searxng:/etc/searxng \  searxng/searxng:latest# Then setSEARXNG_URL=http://localhost:8888
```

Or install via pip:

```
pip install searxng# Edit /etc/searxng/settings.ymlsearxng-run
```

Public SearXNG instances are available at:
  * `https://searxng.example.com` (replace with any public instance)


## Workflow: Search then Extract[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/optional/research/research-searxng-search#workflow-search-then-extract "Direct link to Workflow: Search then Extract")
SearXNG returns titles, URLs, and snippets — not full page content. To get full page content, search first and then extract the most relevant URL with `web_extract`, browser tools, or `curl`.

```
# Search for relevant pagescurl-s"${SEARXNG_URL}/search?q=fastapi+deployment&format=json&limit=3"# Output: list of results with titles and URLs# Then extract the best URL with web_extract
```

## Limitations[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/optional/research/research-searxng-search#limitations "Direct link to Limitations")
  * **Instance availability** : If the SearXNG instance is down or unreachable, search fails. Always check `SEARXNG_URL` is set and the instance is reachable.
  * **No content extraction** : SearXNG returns snippets, not full page content. Use `web_extract`, browser tools, or `curl` for full articles.
  * **Rate limiting** : Some public instances limit requests. Self-hosting avoids this.
  * **Engine coverage** : Available engines depend on the SearXNG instance configuration. Some engines may be disabled.
  * **Results freshness** : Meta-search aggregates external engines — result freshness depends on those engines.


## Troubleshooting[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/optional/research/research-searxng-search#troubleshooting "Direct link to Troubleshooting")  
| Problem  | Likely Cause  | What To Do  |  
| --- | --- | --- |  
|  `SEARXNG_URL` not set  | No instance configured  | Use a public SearXNG instance or set up your own  |  
| Connection refused  | Instance not running or wrong URL  | Check the URL is correct and the instance is running  |  
| Empty results  | Instance blocks the query  | Try a different instance or self-host  |  
| Slow responses  | Public instance under load  | Self-host or use a less-loaded public instance  |  
|  `json` format not supported  | Old SearXNG version  | Try `format=rss` or upgrade SearXNG  |  
## Pitfalls[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/optional/research/research-searxng-search#pitfalls "Direct link to Pitfalls")
  * **Always set`SEARXNG_URL`** : Without it, the skill cannot function.
  * **URL-encode queries** : Spaces and special characters must be URL-encoded in curl, or use `urllib.parse.quote()` in Python.
  * **Use`format=json`** : The default format may not be machine-readable. Always request JSON explicitly.
  * **Set a timeout** : Always use `--max-time` or `timeout=` to avoid hanging on unreachable instances.
  * **Self-hosting is best** : Public instances may go down, rate-limit, or block. A self-hosted instance is reliable.


## Instance Discovery[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/optional/research/research-searxng-search#instance-discovery "Direct link to Instance Discovery")
If `SEARXNG_URL` is not set and the user asks about SearXNG, help them either:
  1. Find a public SearXNG instance (search for "public searxng instance")
  2. Set up their own with Docker or pip
