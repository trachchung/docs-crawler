The following is the complete skill definition that Hermes loads when this skill is triggered. This is what the agent sees as instructions when the skill is active.
# Canvas LMS — Course & Assignment Access
Read-only access to Canvas LMS for listing courses and assignments.
## Scripts[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/optional/productivity/productivity-canvas#scripts "Direct link to Scripts")
  * `scripts/canvas_api.py` — Python CLI for Canvas API calls


## Setup[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/optional/productivity/productivity-canvas#setup "Direct link to Setup")
  1. Log in to your Canvas instance in a browser
  2. Go to **Account → Settings** (click your profile icon, then Settings)
  3. Scroll to **Approved Integrations** and click **+ New Access Token**
  4. Name the token (e.g., "Hermes Agent"), set an optional expiry, and click **Generate Token**
  5. Copy the token and add to `~/.hermes/.env`:



```
CANVAS_API_TOKEN=your_token_hereCANVAS_BASE_URL=https://yourschool.instructure.com
```

The base URL is whatever appears in your browser when you're logged into Canvas (no trailing slash).
## Usage[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/optional/productivity/productivity-canvas#usage "Direct link to Usage")

```
CANVAS="python $HERMES_HOME/skills/productivity/canvas/scripts/canvas_api.py"# List all active courses$CANVAS list_courses --enrollment-state active# List all courses (any state)$CANVAS list_courses# List assignments for a specific course$CANVAS list_assignments 12345# List assignments ordered by due date$CANVAS list_assignments 12345 --order-by due_at
```

## Output Format[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/optional/productivity/productivity-canvas#output-format "Direct link to Output Format")
**list_courses** returns:

```
[{"id":12345,"name":"Intro to CS","course_code":"CS101","workflow_state":"available","start_at":"...","end_at":"..."}]
```

**list_assignments** returns:

```
[{"id":67890,"name":"Homework 1","due_at":"2025-02-15T23:59:00Z","points_possible":100,"submission_types":["online_upload"],"html_url":"...","description":"...","course_id":12345}]
```

Note: Assignment descriptions are truncated to 500 characters. The `html_url` field links to the full assignment page in Canvas.
## API Reference (curl)[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/optional/productivity/productivity-canvas#api-reference-curl "Direct link to API Reference \(curl\)")

```
# List coursescurl-s-H"Authorization: Bearer $CANVAS_API_TOKEN"\"$CANVAS_BASE_URL/api/v1/courses?enrollment_state=active&per_page=10"# List assignments for a coursecurl-s-H"Authorization: Bearer $CANVAS_API_TOKEN"\"$CANVAS_BASE_URL/api/v1/courses/COURSE_ID/assignments?per_page=10&order_by=due_at"
```

Canvas uses `Link` headers for pagination. The Python script handles pagination automatically.
## Rules[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/optional/productivity/productivity-canvas#rules "Direct link to Rules")
  * This skill is **read-only** — it only fetches data, never modifies courses or assignments
  * On first use, verify auth by running `$CANVAS list_courses` — if it fails with 401, guide the user through setup
  * Canvas rate-limits to ~700 requests per 10 minutes; check `X-Rate-Limit-Remaining` header if hitting limits


## Troubleshooting[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/skills/optional/productivity/productivity-canvas#troubleshooting "Direct link to Troubleshooting")  
| Problem  | Fix  |  
| --- | --- |  
| 401 Unauthorized  | Token invalid or expired — regenerate in Canvas Settings  |  
| 403 Forbidden  | Token lacks permission for this course  |  
| Empty course list  | Try `--enrollment-state active` or omit the flag to see all states  |  
| Wrong institution  | Verify `CANVAS_BASE_URL` matches the URL in your browser  |  
| Timeout errors  | Check network connectivity to your Canvas instance  |
