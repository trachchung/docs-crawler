Connect Hermes Agent to Microsoft Teams as a bot. Unlike Slack's Socket Mode, Teams delivers messages by calling a **public HTTPS webhook** , so your instance needs a publicly reachable endpoint — either a dev tunnel (local dev) or a real domain (production).
Need meeting summaries from Microsoft Graph events rather than normal bot conversations? Use the dedicated setup page: [Teams Meetings](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/messaging/teams-meetings).
## How the Bot Responds[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/messaging/teams#how-the-bot-responds "Direct link to How the Bot Responds")  
| Context  | Behavior  |  
| --- | --- |  
| **Personal chat (DM)**  | Bot responds to every message. No @mention needed.  |  
| **Group chat**  | Bot only responds when @mentioned.  |  
| **Channel**  | Bot only responds when @mentioned.  |  
Teams delivers @mentions as regular messages with `<at>BotName</at>` tags, which Hermes strips automatically before processing.
## Step 1: Install the Teams CLI[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/messaging/teams#step-1-install-the-teams-cli "Direct link to Step 1: Install the Teams CLI")
The `@microsoft/teams.cli` automates bot registration — no Azure portal needed.

```
npminstall-g @microsoft/teams.cli@previewteams login
```

To verify your login and find your own AAD object ID (needed for `TEAMS_ALLOWED_USERS`):

```
teams status --verbose
```

## Step 2: Expose the Webhook Port[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/messaging/teams#step-2-expose-the-webhook-port "Direct link to Step 2: Expose the Webhook Port")
Teams cannot deliver messages to `localhost`. For local development, use any tunnel tool to get a public HTTPS URL. The default port is `3978` — change it with `TEAMS_PORT` if needed.

```
# devtunnel (Microsoft)devtunnel create hermes-bot --allow-anonymousdevtunnel port create hermes-bot -p3978--protocol https  # replace 3978 with TEAMS_PORT if changeddevtunnel host hermes-bot# ngrokngrok http 3978# replace 3978 with TEAMS_PORT if changed# cloudflaredcloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3978  # replace 3978 with TEAMS_PORT if changed
```

Copy the `https://` URL from the output — you'll use it in the next step. Leave the tunnel running while developing.
For production, point your bot's endpoint at your server's public domain instead (see [Production Deployment](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/messaging/teams#production-deployment)).
## Step 3: Create the Bot[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/messaging/teams#step-3-create-the-bot "Direct link to Step 3: Create the Bot")

```
teams app create \--name"Hermes"\--endpoint"https://<your-tunnel-url>/api/messages"
```

The CLI outputs your `CLIENT_ID`, `CLIENT_SECRET`, and `TENANT_ID`, plus an install link for Step 6. Save the client secret — it won't be shown again.
## Step 4: Configure Environment Variables[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/messaging/teams#step-4-configure-environment-variables "Direct link to Step 4: Configure Environment Variables")
Add to `~/.hermes/.env`:

```
# RequiredTEAMS_CLIENT_ID=<your-client-id>TEAMS_CLIENT_SECRET=<your-client-secret>TEAMS_TENANT_ID=<your-tenant-id># Restrict access to specific users (recommended)# Use AAD object IDs from `teams status --verbose`TEAMS_ALLOWED_USERS=<your-aad-object-id>
```

## Step 5: Start the Gateway[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/messaging/teams#step-5-start-the-gateway "Direct link to Step 5: Start the Gateway")

```
HERMES_UID=$(id-u)HERMES_GID=$(id-g)docker compose up -d gateway
```

This starts the gateway. The default webhook port is `3978` (override with `TEAMS_PORT`). Check that it's running:

```
curl http://localhost:3978/health   # should return: okdocker logs -f hermes
```

Look for:

```
[teams] Webhook server listening on 0.0.0.0:3978/api/messages
```

## Step 6: Install the App in Teams[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/messaging/teams#step-6-install-the-app-in-teams "Direct link to Step 6: Install the App in Teams")

```
teams app get <teamsAppId> --install-link
```

Open the printed link in your browser — it opens directly in the Teams client. After installing, send a direct message to your bot — it's ready.

### Environment Variables[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/messaging/teams#environment-variables "Direct link to Environment Variables")  
| Variable  | Description  |  
| --- | --- |  
| `TEAMS_CLIENT_ID`  | Azure AD App (client) ID  |  
| `TEAMS_CLIENT_SECRET`  | Azure AD client secret  |  
| `TEAMS_TENANT_ID`  | Azure AD tenant ID  |  
| `TEAMS_ALLOWED_USERS`  | Comma-separated AAD object IDs allowed to use the bot  |

## Features[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/messaging/teams#features "Direct link to Features")
### Interactive Approval Cards[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/messaging/teams#interactive-approval-cards "Direct link to Interactive Approval Cards")
When the agent needs to run a potentially dangerous command, it sends an Adaptive Card with four buttons instead of asking you to type `/approve`:
  * **Allow Once** — approve this specific command
  * **Allow Session** — approve this pattern for the rest of the session
  * **Always Allow** — permanently approve this pattern
  * **Deny** — reject the command


Clicking a button resolves the approval inline and replaces the card with the decision.
### Meeting Summary Delivery (Teams Meeting Pipeline)[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/messaging/teams#meeting-summary-delivery-teams-meeting-pipeline "Direct link to Meeting Summary Delivery \(Teams Meeting Pipeline\)")
When the [Teams meeting pipeline plugin](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/messaging/msgraph-webhook) is enabled, this adapter also handles outbound delivery of meeting summaries — one Teams integration surface, not two. After a meeting's transcript is summarized, the writer posts the summary into your chosen Teams target.
Pipeline summary delivery is configured under the `teams` platform entry alongside the bot config:

```
platforms:teams:enabled:trueextra:# existing bot config (client_id, client_secret, tenant_id, port) ...# Meeting summary delivery (only used when the teams_pipeline plugin is enabled)delivery_mode:"graph"# or "incoming_webhook"# For delivery_mode: graph — pick ONE of:chat_id:"19:meeting_..."# post into a Teams chat# team_id: "..."             # OR post into a channel# channel_id: "..."# access_token: "..."        # optional; falls back to MSGRAPH_* app credentials# For delivery_mode: incoming_webhook:# incoming_webhook_url: "https://outlook.office.com/webhook/..."
```
  
| Mode  | Use when  | Trade-off  |  
| --- | --- | --- |  
| `incoming_webhook`  | Simple "post a summary into this channel" with a static Teams-generated URL.  | No reply threading, no reactions, shows as the webhook's configured identity.  |  
| `graph`  | Threaded channel posts or 1:1/group chat posts under the bot's identity via Microsoft Graph.  | Requires the [Graph app registration](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/guides/microsoft-graph-app-registration) with `ChannelMessage.Send` (channel) or `Chat.ReadWrite.All` (chat) application permissions.  |  
If the `teams_pipeline` plugin is **not** enabled, these settings are inert — they only wire up when the pipeline runtime binds to the Graph webhook ingress.
## Production Deployment[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/messaging/teams#production-deployment "Direct link to Production Deployment")
For a permanent server, skip devtunnel and register your bot with your server's public HTTPS endpoint:

```
teams app create \--name"Hermes"\--endpoint"https://your-domain.com/api/messages"
```

If you've already created the bot and just need to update the endpoint:

```
teams app update --id<teamsAppId>--endpoint"https://your-domain.com/api/messages"
```

Make sure your configured port (`TEAMS_PORT`, default `3978`) is reachable from the internet and that your TLS certificate is valid — Teams rejects self-signed certificates.
## Troubleshooting[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/messaging/teams#troubleshooting "Direct link to Troubleshooting")  
| Problem  | Solution  |  
| --- | --- |  
|  `health` endpoint works but bot doesn't respond  | Check that your tunnel is still running and the bot's messaging endpoint matches the tunnel URL  |  
|  `KeyError: 'teams'` in logs  | Restart the container — this is fixed in the current version  |  
| Bot responds with auth errors  | Verify `TEAMS_CLIENT_ID`, `TEAMS_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `TEAMS_TENANT_ID` are all set correctly  |  
| `No inference provider configured`  | Check that `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (or another provider key) is set in `~/.hermes/.env`  |  
| Bot receives messages but ignores them  | Your AAD object ID may not be in `TEAMS_ALLOWED_USERS`. Run `teams status --verbose` to find it  |  
| Tunnel URL changes on restart  | devtunnel URLs are persistent if you use a named tunnel (`devtunnel create hermes-bot`). ngrok and cloudflared generate a new URL each run unless you have a paid plan — update the bot endpoint with `teams app update` when it changes  |  
| Teams shows "This bot is not responding"  | The webhook returned an error. Check `docker logs hermes` for tracebacks  |  
|  `[teams] Failed to connect` in logs  | The SDK failed to authenticate. Double-check your credentials and that the tenant ID matches the account you used in `teams login`  |  
## Security[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/messaging/teams#security "Direct link to Security")
**Always set`TEAMS_ALLOWED_USERS`** with the AAD object IDs of authorized users. Without this, anyone who can find or install your bot can interact with it.
Treat `TEAMS_CLIENT_SECRET` like a password — rotate it periodically via the Azure portal or Teams CLI.
  * Store credentials in `~/.hermes/.env` with permissions `600` (`chmod 600 ~/.hermes/.env`)
  * The bot only accepts messages from users in `TEAMS_ALLOWED_USERS`; unauthorized messages are silently dropped
  * Your public endpoint (`/api/messages`) is authenticated by the Teams Bot Framework — requests without valid JWTs are rejected
