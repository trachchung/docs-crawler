The following is the complete skill definition that Hermes loads when this skill is triggered. This is what the agent sees as instructions when the skill is active.
# Polymarket — Prediction Market Data
Query prediction market data from Polymarket using their public REST APIs. All endpoints are read-only and require zero authentication.
See `references/api-endpoints.md` for the full endpoint reference with curl examples.
## When to Use[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/zh-Hans/user-guide/skills/bundled/research/research-polymarket#when-to-use "When to Use的直接链接")
  * User asks about prediction markets, betting odds, or event probabilities
  * User wants to know "what are the odds of X happening?"
  * User asks about Polymarket specifically
  * User wants market prices, orderbook data, or price history
  * User asks to monitor or track prediction market movements


## Key Concepts[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/zh-Hans/user-guide/skills/bundled/research/research-polymarket#key-concepts "Key Concepts的直接链接")
  * **Events** contain one or more **Markets** (1:many relationship)
  * **Markets** are binary outcomes with Yes/No prices between 0.00 and 1.00
  * Prices ARE probabilities: price 0.65 means the market thinks 65% likely
  * `outcomePrices` field: JSON-encoded array like `["0.80", "0.20"]`
  * `clobTokenIds` field: JSON-encoded array of two token IDs [Yes, No] for price/book queries
  * `conditionId` field: hex string used for price history queries
  * Volume is in USDC (US dollars)


## Three Public APIs[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/zh-Hans/user-guide/skills/bundled/research/research-polymarket#three-public-apis "Three Public APIs的直接链接")
  1. **Gamma API** at `gamma-api.polymarket.com` — Discovery, search, browsing
  2. **CLOB API** at `clob.polymarket.com` — Real-time prices, orderbooks, history
  3. **Data API** at `data-api.polymarket.com` — Trades, open interest


## Typical Workflow[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/zh-Hans/user-guide/skills/bundled/research/research-polymarket#typical-workflow "Typical Workflow的直接链接")
When a user asks about prediction market odds:
  1. **Search** using the Gamma API public-search endpoint with their query
  2. **Parse** the response — extract events and their nested markets
  3. **Present** market question, current prices as percentages, and volume
  4. **Deep dive** if asked — use clobTokenIds for orderbook, conditionId for history


## Presenting Results[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/zh-Hans/user-guide/skills/bundled/research/research-polymarket#presenting-results "Presenting Results的直接链接")
Format prices as percentages for readability:
  * outcomePrices `["0.652", "0.348"]` becomes "Yes: 65.2%, No: 34.8%"
  * Always show the market question and probability
  * Include volume when available


Example: `"Will X happen?" — 65.2% Yes ($1.2M volume)`
## Parsing Double-Encoded Fields[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/zh-Hans/user-guide/skills/bundled/research/research-polymarket#parsing-double-encoded-fields "Parsing Double-Encoded Fields的直接链接")
The Gamma API returns `outcomePrices`, `outcomes`, and `clobTokenIds` as JSON strings inside JSON responses (double-encoded). When processing with Python, parse them with `json.loads(market['outcomePrices'])` to get the actual array.
## Rate Limits[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/zh-Hans/user-guide/skills/bundled/research/research-polymarket#rate-limits "Rate Limits的直接链接")
Generous — unlikely to hit for normal usage:
  * Gamma: 4,000 requests per 10 seconds (general)
  * CLOB: 9,000 requests per 10 seconds (general)
  * Data: 1,000 requests per 10 seconds (general)


## Limitations[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/zh-Hans/user-guide/skills/bundled/research/research-polymarket#limitations "Limitations的直接链接")
  * This skill is read-only — it does not support placing trades
  * Trading requires wallet-based crypto authentication (EIP-712 signatures)
  * Some new markets may have empty price history
  * Geographic restrictions apply to trading but read-only data is globally accessible
