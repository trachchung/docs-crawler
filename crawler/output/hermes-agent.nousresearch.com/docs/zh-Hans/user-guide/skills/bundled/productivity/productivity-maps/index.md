The following is the complete skill definition that Hermes loads when this skill is triggered. This is what the agent sees as instructions when the skill is active.
# Maps Skill
Location intelligence using free, open data sources. 8 commands, 44 POI categories, zero dependencies (Python stdlib only), no API key required.
Data sources: OpenStreetMap/Nominatim, Overpass API, OSRM, TimeAPI.io.
This skill supersedes the old `find-nearby` skill — all of find-nearby's functionality is covered by the `nearby` command below, with the same `--near "<place>"` shortcut and multi-category support.
## When to Use[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/zh-Hans/user-guide/skills/bundled/productivity/productivity-maps#when-to-use "When to Use的直接链接")
  * User sends a Telegram location pin (latitude/longitude in the message) → `nearby`
  * User wants coordinates for a place name → `search`
  * User has coordinates and wants the address → `reverse`
  * User asks for nearby restaurants, hospitals, pharmacies, hotels, etc. → `nearby`
  * User wants driving/walking/cycling distance or travel time → `distance`
  * User wants turn-by-turn directions between two places → `directions`
  * User wants timezone information for a location → `timezone`
  * User wants to search for POIs within a geographic area → `area` + `bbox`


## Prerequisites[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/zh-Hans/user-guide/skills/bundled/productivity/productivity-maps#prerequisites "Prerequisites的直接链接")

### timezone — Timezone for coordinates[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/zh-Hans/user-guide/skills/bundled/productivity/productivity-maps#timezone--timezone-for-coordinates "timezone — Timezone for coordinates的直接链接")

```
python3 $MAPS timezone 48.85842.2945python3 $MAPS timezone 35.6762139.6503
```

Returns timezone name, UTC offset, and current local time.
### area — Bounding box and area for a place[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/zh-Hans/user-guide/skills/bundled/productivity/productivity-maps#area--bounding-box-and-area-for-a-place "area — Bounding box and area for a place的直接链接")

Returns bounding box coordinates, width/height in km, and approximate area. Useful as input for the bbox command.
### bbox — Search within a bounding box[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/zh-Hans/user-guide/skills/bundled/productivity/productivity-maps#bbox--search-within-a-bounding-box "bbox — Search within a bounding box的直接链接")

```
python3 $MAPS bbox 40.75-74.0040.77-73.98 restaurant --limit20
```

Finds POIs within a geographic rectangle. Use `area` first to get the bounding box coordinates for a named place.
## Working With Telegram Location Pins[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/zh-Hans/user-guide/skills/bundled/productivity/productivity-maps#working-with-telegram-location-pins "Working With Telegram Location Pins的直接链接")
When a user sends a location pin, the message contains `latitude:` and `longitude:` fields. Extract those and pass them straight to `nearby`:

```
# User sent a pin at 36.17, -115.14 and asked "find cafes nearby"python3 $MAPS nearby 36.17-115.14 cafe --radius1500
```

Present results as a numbered list with names, distances, and the `maps_url` field so the user gets a tap-to-open link in chat. For "open now?" questions, check the `hours` field; if missing or unclear, verify with `web_search` since OSM hours are community-maintained and not always current.
## Workflow Examples[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/zh-Hans/user-guide/skills/bundled/productivity/productivity-maps#workflow-examples "Workflow Examples的直接链接")
**"Find Italian restaurants near the Colosseum":**
  1. `nearby --near "Colosseum Rome" --category restaurant --radius 500` — one command, auto-geocoded


**"What's near this location pin they sent?":**
  1. Extract lat/lon from the Telegram message
  2. `nearby LAT LON cafe --radius 1500`


**"How do I walk from hotel to conference center?":**
  1. `directions "Hotel Name" --to "Conference Center" --mode walking`


**"What restaurants are in downtown Seattle?":**
  1. `area "Downtown Seattle"` → get bounding box
  2. `bbox S W N E restaurant --limit 30`


## Pitfalls[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/zh-Hans/user-guide/skills/bundled/productivity/productivity-maps#pitfalls "Pitfalls的直接链接")
  * Nominatim ToS: max 1 req/s (handled automatically by the script)
  * `nearby` requires lat/lon OR `--near "<address>"` — one of the two is needed
  * OSRM routing coverage is best for Europe and North America
  * Overpass API can be slow during peak hours; the script automatically falls back between mirrors (overpass-api.de → overpass.kumi.systems)
  * `distance` and `directions` use `--to` flag for the destination (not positional)
  * If a zip code alone gives ambiguous results globally, include country/state
