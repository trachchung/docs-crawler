Hermes Agent can automatically snapshot your project before **destructive operations** and restore it with a single command. Checkpoints are **opt-in** as of v2 — most users never use `/rollback`, and the shadow-store storage is non-trivial over time, so the default is off.
Enable checkpoints per-session with `--checkpoints`:

```
hermes chat --checkpoints
```

Or enable globally in `~/.hermes/config.yaml`:

```
checkpoints:enabled:true
```

This safety net is powered by an internal **Checkpoint Manager** that keeps a single shared shadow git repository under `~/.hermes/checkpoints/store/` — your real project `.git` is never touched. Every project the agent works in shares the same store, so git's content-addressable object DB deduplicates across projects and across turns.
## What Triggers a Checkpoint[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/zh-Hans/user-guide/checkpoints-and-rollback#what-triggers-a-checkpoint "What Triggers a Checkpoint的直接链接")
Checkpoints are taken automatically before:
  * **File tools** — `write_file` and `patch`
  * **Destructive terminal commands** — `rm`, `rmdir`, `cp`, `install`, `mv`, `sed -i`, `truncate`, `dd`, `shred`, output redirects (`>`), and `git reset`/`clean`/`checkout`


The agent creates **at most one checkpoint per directory per turn** , so long-running sessions don't spam snapshots.

## How Checkpoints Work[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/zh-Hans/user-guide/checkpoints-and-rollback#how-checkpoints-work "How Checkpoints Work的直接链接")
At a high level:
  * Hermes detects when tools are about to **modify files** in your working tree.
  * Once per conversation turn (per directory), it: 
    * Resolves a reasonable project root for the file.
    * Initialises or reuses the **single shared shadow store** at `~/.hermes/checkpoints/store/`.
    * Stages into a per-project index, builds a tree, and commits to a per-project ref (`refs/hermes/<project-hash>`).
  * These per-project refs form a checkpoint history that you can inspect and restore via `/rollback`.

## Configuration[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/zh-Hans/user-guide/checkpoints-and-rollback#configuration "Configuration的直接链接")
Configure in `~/.hermes/config.yaml`:

```
checkpoints:enabled:false# master switch (default: false — opt-in)max_snapshots:20# max checkpoints per project (enforced via ref rewrite + gc)max_total_size_mb:500# hard cap on total store size; oldest commits droppedmax_file_size_mb:10# skip any single file larger than this# Auto-maintenance (on by default): sweep ~/.hermes/checkpoints/ at startup# and delete project entries whose working directory no longer exists# (orphans) or whose last_touch is older than retention_days. Runs at most# once per min_interval_hours, tracked via a .last_prune marker.auto_prune:trueretention_days:7delete_orphans:truemin_interval_hours:24
```

To disable everything:

```
checkpoints:enabled:falseauto_prune:false
```

When `enabled: false`, the Checkpoint Manager is a no-op and never attempts git operations. When `auto_prune: false`, the store grows until you run `hermes checkpoints prune` manually.
## Listing Checkpoints[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/zh-Hans/user-guide/checkpoints-and-rollback#listing-checkpoints "Listing Checkpoints的直接链接")
From a CLI session:

```
/rollback
```

Hermes responds with a formatted list showing change statistics:

```
📸 Checkpoints for /path/to/project:  1. 4270a8c  2026-03-16 04:36  before patch  (1 file, +1/-0)  2. eaf4c1f  2026-03-16 04:35  before write_file  3. b3f9d2e  2026-03-16 04:34  before terminal: sed -i s/old/new/ config.py  (1 file, +1/-1)  /rollback <N>             restore to checkpoint N  /rollback diff <N>        preview changes since checkpoint N  /rollback <N> <file>      restore a single file from checkpoint N
```

## Inspecting the Store from the Shell[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/zh-Hans/user-guide/checkpoints-and-rollback#inspecting-the-store-from-the-shell "Inspecting the Store from the Shell的直接链接")

```
hermes checkpoints
```

Sample output:

```
Checkpoint base: /home/you/.hermes/checkpointsTotal size:      142.3 MB  store/         138.1 MB  legacy-*       4.2 MBProjects:        12  WORKDIR                                                       COMMITS    LAST TOUCH  STATE  /home/you/code/hermes-agent                                        20       2h ago  live  /home/you/code/experiments/rl-runner                                8       1d ago  live  /home/you/code/old-prototype                                        3       9d ago  orphan  ...Legacy archives (1):  legacy-20260506-050616                           4.2 MBClear with: hermes checkpoints clear-legacy
```

Force a full sweep (ignores the 24h idempotency marker):

```
hermes checkpoints prune --retention-days 3 --max-size-mb 200
```

## Previewing Changes with `/rollback diff`[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/zh-Hans/user-guide/checkpoints-and-rollback#previewing-changes-with-rollback-diff "previewing-changes-with-rollback-diff的直接链接")
Before committing to a restore, preview what has changed since a checkpoint:

```
/rollback diff 1
```

This shows a git diff stat summary followed by the actual diff.
## Restoring with `/rollback`[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/zh-Hans/user-guide/checkpoints-and-rollback#restoring-with-rollback "restoring-with-rollback的直接链接")

```
/rollback 1
```

Behind the scenes, Hermes:
  1. Verifies the target commit exists in the shadow store.
  2. Takes a **pre-rollback snapshot** of the current state so you can "undo the undo" later.
  3. Restores tracked files in your working directory.
  4. **Undoes the last conversation turn** so the agent's context matches the restored filesystem state.


## Single-File Restore[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/zh-Hans/user-guide/checkpoints-and-rollback#single-file-restore "Single-File Restore的直接链接")
Restore just one file from a checkpoint without affecting the rest of the directory:

```
/rollback 1 src/broken_file.py
```

## Safety and Performance Guards[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/zh-Hans/user-guide/checkpoints-and-rollback#safety-and-performance-guards "Safety and Performance Guards的直接链接")
  * **Git availability** — if `git` is not found on `PATH`, checkpoints are transparently disabled.
  * **Directory scope** — Hermes skips overly broad directories (root `/`, home `$HOME`).
  * **Repository size** — directories with more than 50,000 files are skipped.
  * **Per-file size cap** — files larger than `max_file_size_mb` (default 10 MB) are excluded from the snapshot. Prevents accidentally swallowing datasets, model weights, or generated media.
  * **Total store size cap** — when the store exceeds `max_total_size_mb` (default 500 MB), the oldest commit per project is dropped round-robin until under the cap.
  * **Real pruning** — `max_snapshots` is enforced by rewriting the per-project ref and running `git gc --prune=now` afterwards, so loose objects don't accumulate.
  * **No-change snapshots** — if there are no changes since the last snapshot, the checkpoint is skipped.
  * **Non-fatal errors** — all errors inside the Checkpoint Manager are logged at debug level; your tools continue to run.


## Where Checkpoints Live[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/zh-Hans/user-guide/checkpoints-and-rollback#where-checkpoints-live "Where Checkpoints Live的直接链接")

```
~/.hermes/checkpoints/  ├── store/                 # single shared bare git repo  │   ├── HEAD, objects/     # git internals (shared across projects)  │   ├── refs/hermes/<hash> # per-project branch tip  │   ├── indexes/<hash>     # per-project git index  │   ├── projects/<hash>.json  # workdir + created_at + last_touch  │   └── info/exclude  ├── .last_prune            # auto-prune idempotency marker  └── legacy-<ts>/           # archived pre-v2 per-project shadow repos
```

Each `<hash>` is derived from the absolute path of the working directory. You normally never need to touch these manually — use `hermes checkpoints status` / `prune` / `clear` instead.
### Migration from v1[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/zh-Hans/user-guide/checkpoints-and-rollback#migration-from-v1 "Migration from v1的直接链接")
Before the v2 rewrite, each working directory got its own complete shadow git repo directly under `~/.hermes/checkpoints/<hash>/`. That layout couldn't dedup objects across projects and had a documented no-op pruner — the store would grow without bound.
On first v2 run, any pre-v2 shadow repos are moved into `~/.hermes/checkpoints/legacy-<timestamp>/` so the new single-store layout starts clean. Old `/rollback` history is still reachable by manually inspecting the legacy archive with `git`; once you're confident you don't need it, run:

```
hermes checkpoints clear-legacy
```

to reclaim the space. Legacy archives are also swept by `auto_prune` after `retention_days`.
## Best Practices[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/zh-Hans/user-guide/checkpoints-and-rollback#best-practices "Best Practices的直接链接")
  * **Enable checkpoints only when you need them** — `hermes chat --checkpoints` or per-profile `enabled: true`.
  * **Use`/rollback diff` before restoring** — preview what will change to pick the right checkpoint.
  * **Use`/rollback` instead of `git reset`** when you want to undo agent-driven changes only.
  * **Check`hermes checkpoints status` occasionally** if you use checkpoints regularly — shows which projects are active and what the store costs you.
  * **Combine with Git worktrees** for maximum safety — keep each Hermes session in its own worktree/branch, with checkpoints as an extra layer.
