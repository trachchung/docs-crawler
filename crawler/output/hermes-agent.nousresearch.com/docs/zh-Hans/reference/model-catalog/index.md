Hermes fetches curated model lists for **OpenRouter** and **Nous Portal** from a JSON manifest hosted alongside the docs site. This lets maintainers update picker lists without shipping a new `hermes-agent` release.
When the manifest is unreachable (offline, network blocked, hosting failure), Hermes silently falls back to the in-repo snapshot that ships with the CLI. The manifest never breaks the picker — worst case you see whatever list was bundled with your installed version.
## Live manifest URL[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/zh-Hans/reference/model-catalog#live-manifest-url "Live manifest URL的直接链接")

```
https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/api/model-catalog.json
```

Published on every merge to `main` via the existing `deploy-site.yml` GitHub Pages pipeline. The source of truth lives in the repo at `website/static/api/model-catalog.json`.
## Schema[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/zh-Hans/reference/model-catalog#schema "Schema的直接链接")

```
"version":1,"updated_at":"2026-04-25T22:00:00Z","metadata":{},"providers":{"openrouter":{"metadata":{},"models":[{"id":"moonshotai/kimi-k2.6","description":"recommended","metadata":{}},{"id":"openai/gpt-5.4","description":""}"nous":{"metadata":{},"models":[{"id":"anthropic/claude-opus-4.7"},{"id":"moonshotai/kimi-k2.6"}
```

Field notes:
  * **`version`**— integer schema version. Future schemas bump this; Hermes refuses manifests with versions it doesn't understand and falls back to the hardcoded snapshot.
  * **`metadata`**— free-form dict at the manifest, provider, and model level. Any keys. Hermes ignores unknown fields, so you can annotate entries (`"tier": "paid"` , `"tags": [...]`, etc.) without coordinating a schema change.
  * **`description`**— OpenRouter-only. Drives picker badge text (`"recommended"` , `"free"`, or empty). Nous Portal doesn't use this — free-tier gating is determined live from the Portal's pricing endpoint.
  * **Pricing and context length** are NOT in the manifest. Those come from live provider APIs (`/v1/models` endpoints, models.dev) at fetch time.


## Fetch behavior[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/zh-Hans/reference/model-catalog#fetch-behavior "Fetch behavior的直接链接")  
| When  | What happens  |  
| --- | --- |  
|  `/model` or `hermes model`  | Fetches if disk cache is stale, else uses cache  |  
| Disk cache fresh (< TTL)  | No network hit  |  
| Network failure with cache  | Silent fallback to cache, one log line  |  
| Network failure, no cache  | Silent fallback to in-repo snapshot  |  
| Manifest fails schema validation  | Treated as unreachable  |  
Cache location: `~/.hermes/cache/model_catalog.json`.
## Config[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/zh-Hans/reference/model-catalog#config "Config的直接链接")

```
model_catalog:enabled:trueurl: https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/api/model-catalog.jsonttl_hours:24providers:{}
```

Set `enabled: false` to disable remote fetch entirely and always use the in-repo snapshot.
### Per-provider override URLs[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/zh-Hans/reference/model-catalog#per-provider-override-urls "Per-provider override URLs的直接链接")
Third parties can self-host their own curation list using the same schema. Point a provider at a custom URL:

```
model_catalog:providers:openrouter:url: https://example.com/my-openrouter-curation.json
```

The overriding manifest only needs to populate the provider block(s) it cares about. Other providers continue to resolve against the master URL.
## Updating the manifest[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/zh-Hans/reference/model-catalog#updating-the-manifest "Updating the manifest的直接链接")
Maintainers:

```
# Re-generate from the in-repo hardcoded lists (keeps manifest in sync after# editing OPENROUTER_MODELS or _PROVIDER_MODELS["nous"] in hermes_cli/models.py).python scripts/build_model_catalog.py
```

Then PR the resulting change to `website/static/api/model-catalog.json` to `main`. The docs site auto-deploys on merge and the new manifest is live within a few minutes.
You can also hand-edit the JSON directly for fine-grained metadata changes that don't belong in the in-repo snapshot — the generator script is a convenience, not the single source of truth.
