#### 
How do I set up a referral campaign?
PayRam’s dashboard provides a **Referral Campaign** workflow (under _Growth → Campaigns_). To set one up:
  * **Create a new campaign** : In the PayRam Dashboard, go to _Growth → Campaigns → Create New Campaign_. Enter the campaign name, description, budget, duration, and select which events will trigger rewards. Campaigns are tied to a specific project and have their own event rules. Save the campaign – PayRam will generate an `event_key` (a unique identifier for your trigger event).
  * **Embed referral dashboard** : Use PayRam’s iframe-based referral dashboard on your site. Your backend must call PayRam’s referral-auth API to get an iframe URL, then set an `<iframe>` on your page with that URL. This allows users to log in to the referral dashboard.
  * **Link referrers and referees** : When a new user signs up with a referral code (from a referrer), call the PayRam **Referee** API. Send a POST to `/api/v1/referral/referee` with your API key and a JSON body including the referee’s email, the referrer’s code, and a unique referenceID. This links the new user to their referrer in PayRam’s system.
  * **Trigger events** : When a configured action happens (e.g. first purchase), call the **Event Log** API. Send a POST to `/api/v1/referral/event-log` with your API key and JSON containing `eventKey` (the key from campaign setup), the referee’s referenceID, and optionally `amount`. This notifies PayRam of the event so it can apply rewards.


By following these steps (create campaign, embed the widget, link users, and log events), you fully integrate PayRam’s referral/affiliate system.
