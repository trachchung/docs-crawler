## 
Introduction
The PayRam TypeScript SDK helps your backend communicate smoothly with your self-hosted PayRam server. It provides a clean, type-safe interface so you don’t have to manually handle raw API calls, making integration simpler and more reliable. The SDK also includes built-in support for safe request retries and offers framework-friendly helpers for handling webhooks with minimal setup.
### 
Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have:
  * Your PayRam API Key, which is required for authenticating all requests sent through the SDK.
  * The Base URL of your PayRam server, which tells the SDK where your self-hosted PayRam instance is running.


## 
Installation
Install the SDK using your package manager of choice
npm
yarn
pnpm
Copy
```
npminstallpayram
```

Copy
```
yarnaddpayram
```

Copy
```
pnpmaddpayram
```

## 
QuickStart
  * Create a new PayRam client instance by passing your API key and server URL.
  * You can also provide optional configuration values such as timeouts and retry settings.


Copy
```
import{Payram}from'payram';
constpayram=newPayram({
apiKey:process.env.PAYRAM_API_KEY!,//required
baseUrl:process.env.PAYRAM_BASE_URL!,//required
config:{
timeoutMs:10_000,// Optional
maxRetries:2,// Optional
retryPolicy:'safe',// Optional
    // allowInsecureHttp: true,             // Optional
});
```

Option
Type
Description
apiKey
string
Your PayRam API key used to authenticate all SDK requests.
baseUrl
string
The base URL of your self-hosted PayRam server.
timeoutMs
number
Request timeout in milliseconds.
maxRetries
number
Maximum number of retry attempts for a request.
retryPolicy
'none' | 'safe' | 'aggressive'
Controls retry behavior — none disables retries, safe retries idempotent calls, and aggressive retries all requests.
allowInsecureHttp
boolean
Set to false only if your PayRam server is running on an http:// URL (without SSL). Keep it true for https:// 
## 
Payments
In this section you'll get all the methods which are related to the payments
### 
Create Payments
  * Creates a new payment session by sending customer details and the amount to PayRam, and returns both a unique reference_id for tracking and a redirect URL that your customer can visit to complete the payment.
  * These are the required fields you must include when creating a payment request using the PayRam SDK.


Field
Description
Required
customerEmail
Customer’s email address where the payment link will be sent/associated.
✅ Yes
customerId
Unique identifier for the customer.
✅ Yes
amountInUSD
The payment amount in USD.
✅ Yes
Copy
```
// Start a new payment
const checkout = await payram.payments.initiatePayment({
  customerEmail: 'customer@example.com',
  customerId: 'cust_123',
  amountInUSD: 49.99,
});
console.log(checkout.reference_id);  // unique payment ID
console.log(checkout.url);  // redirect your customer here
```

circle-info
**Note : The url field provides a ready-to-use PayRam payment page. You can share this link directly with your customers, or build a custom UI using other API endpoints.**
### 
Payment Status
  * Fetches the latest payment details using the reference_id and returns the current paymentState so you can track whether the payment is pending, completed, or failed.


Copy
```
const payment = await payram.payments.getPaymentRequest(checkout.reference_id);
console.log(payment.paymentState);
```

  * Shows all payment states and what each one means.


Status
Description
OPEN
The payment has not been processed yet.
CANCELLED
The payment link has expired or was cancelled.
FILLED
The user has paid the full requested amount.
PARTIALLY_FILLED
The user has paid less than the requested amount.
OVER_FILLED
The user has paid more than the requested amount.
## 
Payout
In this section you'll get all the methods which are related to the payments
### 
Create Payout
  * Creates a new payout request by sending the merchant details, token information, amount, and destination wallet address to the PayRam server.
  * These are the required fields you must send when creating a payout through the PayRam SDK.


Field
Description
Required
email
Recipient’s email address.
✅ Yes
blockchainCode
Blockchain network used for the payout (e.g., ETH, TRX, BASE).
✅ Yes
currencyCode
Token symbol used for the payout (e.g., USDC, USDT).
✅ Yes
amount
Amount to transfer.
✅ Yes
toAddress
Recipient’s wallet address on the selected blockchain.
✅ Yes
customerID
Unique identifier for the customer.
✅ Yes
circle-info
**Note: PayRam currently supports payouts in USDT (ETH, TRX) and USDC (ETH, BASE). Make sure the selected currency matches a supported network when creating a payout.**
Copy
```
await payram.payouts.createPayout({
  email: 'merchant@example.com',
  blockchainCode: 'ETH',
  currencyCode: 'USDT',
  amount: '125.50',
  toAddress: '0xfeedfacecafebeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeef',
  customerID: 414817384
});
```

### 
Payout Status
  * Retrieves the latest payout details using its ID so you can check whether the payout is still pending, awaiting approval, processing on-chain, completed, or failed.


Copy
```
const payout = await payram.payouts.getPayoutById(42);
console.log(payout.status);
```

  * Shows all payment states and what each one means.


Status
Description
pending-otp-verification
Waiting for OTP verification before processing.
pending-approval
Awaiting admin or system approval.
pending
Approved and ready for blockchain processing.
initiated

sent
The payout has been successfully sent to the recipient.
failed
The transaction failed due to a processing error.
rejected

processed
The payout is confirmed on-chain and recorded in the accounting.
cancelled
The transaction was stopped before being sent or processed.
## 
Webhook
PayRam sends webhook events to your server whenever something important happens, such as a payment updates.
The SDK provides ready-to-use handlers for Express, Fastify, and Next.js (both App Router and Pages Router). These handlers help you process webhooks safely and correctly. They do the following:
  * Check the API-Key header to confirm the request really came from your PayRam server
  * Read and validate the webhook payload
  * Send back the correct response so PayRam knows your server received the event


Express Example
Fastify Example
Next.js Example (App Router)
Copy
```
import express from 'express';
import { Payram } from 'payram';
const app = express();
const payram = new Payram({
  apiKey: process.env.PAYRAM_API_KEY!,
  baseUrl: process.env.PAYRAM_BASE_URL!,
});
app.post(
  '/payram/webhook',
  payram.webhooks.expressWebhook(async (payload, req) => {
    console.log('Received Payram event:', payload.event, payload.reference_id);
    // handle payment / referral events here
  }),
app.listen(3000);
```

Copy
```
import Fastify from 'fastify';
import { Payram } from 'payram';
const fastify = Fastify();
const payram = new Payram({
  apiKey: process.env.PAYRAM_API_KEY!,
  baseUrl: process.env.PAYRAM_BASE_URL!,
});
fastify.post(
  '/payram/webhook',
  payram.webhooks.fastifyWebhook(async (payload, request) => {
    console.log('Payram webhook event:', payload.event, payload.reference_id);
    // handle payment / referral events here
  }),
await fastify.listen({ port: 3000 });
```

Copy
```
// app/api/payram/webhook/route.ts
import { NextRequest } from 'next/server';
import { Payram } from 'payram';
const payram = new Payram({
  apiKey: process.env.PAYRAM_API_KEY!,
  baseUrl: process.env.PAYRAM_BASE_URL!,
});
export const POST = payram.webhooks.nextAppRouterWebhook(
  async (payload, req: NextRequest) => {
    console.log('Payram webhook event:', payload.event, payload.reference_id);
    // handle payment / referral events here

```

circle-info
**Note: The adapter handles verification and sends the reply automatically. No manual res.status(200) is required.**
## 
Validate Api Key
The verifyApiKey function lets you manually check the API key inside your request handler. Use it when you are handling webhooks with a custom framework and need to confirm the request is really from your PayRam server.
Copy
```
import { verifyApiKey } from 'payram';
if (!verifyApiKey(req.headers, process.env.PAYRAM_API_KEY!)) {
  return res.status(401).json({ error: 'invalid-key' });
const payload = req.body;
handleEvent(payload);
```
